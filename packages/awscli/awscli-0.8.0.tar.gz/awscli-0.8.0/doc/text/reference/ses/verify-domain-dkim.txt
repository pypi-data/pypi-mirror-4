verify-domain-dkim
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns a set of DNS records, or *tokens* , that must be published in
the domain name's DNS to complete the DKIM verification process. These
tokens are DNS "CNAME" records that point to DKIM public keys hosted
by Amazon SES. To complete the DKIM verification process, these tokens
must be published in the domain's DNS. The tokens must remain
published in order for Easy DKIM signing to function correctly.

After the tokens are added to the domain's DNS, Amazon SES will be
able to DKIM-sign email originating from that domain. To enable or
disable Easy DKIM signing for a domain, use the "set-identity-dkim-
enabled" action.

For more information about Easy DKIM, go to the Amazon SES Developer
Guide .
