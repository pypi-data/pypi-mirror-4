REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--marker"  (string)
   Use this only when paginating results, and only in a subsequent
   request after you've received a response where the results are
   truncated. Set it to the value of the "--marker" element in the
   response you just received.

"--path-prefix"  (string)
   The path prefix for filtering the results. For example:
   "/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/" , which would get all groups whose
   path starts with "/division_abc/subdivision_xyz/" .

   This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
   slash (/), listing all groups.

"--max-items"  (integer)
   Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum
   number of groups you want in the response. If there are additional
   groups beyond the maximum you specify, the "IsTruncated" response
   element is "true" .
