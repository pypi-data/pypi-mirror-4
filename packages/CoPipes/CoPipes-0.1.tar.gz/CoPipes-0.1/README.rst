A library provides utilities for creating data-processing pipelines based
on coroutines.  The project is inspirited by David Beazley's presentations:

*   `Generator Tricks for Systems Programmers
    <http://www.dabeaz.com/generators/>`_
*   `A Curious Course on Coroutines and Concurrency
    <http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/>`_

See source code of ``copipes/example.py`` and read doc-strings for
details of usage.
