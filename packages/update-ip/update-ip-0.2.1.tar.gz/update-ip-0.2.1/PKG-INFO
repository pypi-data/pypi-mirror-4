Description: =========
        update-ip
        =========
        
        An extensible Python utility to automatically update your IP address with
        dynamic DNS services.  This initial release only supports WebFaction, but
        other services will be coming soon.  This utility was designed to be run
        periodically through a scheduling utility like cron to keep your IP address
        current.
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        To install::
        
            pip install update-ip
        
        Initial Setup
        *************
        
        A small text file is created to keep track of your current IP address.  Before
        beginning regular use, update-ip needs to be run manually first with a list
        of domain names to update the IP address for::
        
            $ update-ip -f /tmp/public_ip.txt -u myusername -p mypass \
            -d my.awesomedomain.com,even.coolerdomain.com webfaction
        
        The filename is the name of the file that will be created and then read each
        time the utility is run.  The username and password are for the dynamic DNS
        service.  The domains should be separated by commas, with no spaces.  The
        service name is the name of a module within *update_ip/services/*.
        
        Automatic Domains
        *****************
        
        After the first run, the text file should be in place.  You can then run the
        script without specifically indicating the domains to update.  When your IP
        changes, the script will check each domain on the dynamic DNS service and
        determine which ones are currently using your old domain.  It will use those
        domains when it updates the service to your new IP.
