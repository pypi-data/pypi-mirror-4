Description: ==================
        django-easyfilters
        ==================
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        This library provides filters similar in some ways to ``list_filter`` and
        ``date_hierarchy`` in Django's admin, but for use outside the
        admin. Importantly, it also includes result counts for the choices. It is
        designed to be very easy to get started with.
        
        Download/install
        ================
        Just install as a Python library.

        * Cleaned up internal ``Filter`` implementation/API
