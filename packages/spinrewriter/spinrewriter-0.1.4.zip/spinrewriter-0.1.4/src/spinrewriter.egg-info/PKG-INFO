        Python bindings for SpinRewriter API
        ====================================
        
        `Spin Rewriter <http://www.spinrewriter.com/bigcontentsearch>`_ is an online
        service for spinning text (synonym substitution) that creates unique version(s)
        of existing text. This package provides a way to easily interact with
        `SpinRewriter API <http://www.spinrewriter.com/api>`_. Usage requires an
        account, `get one here <http://www.spinrewriter.com/registration>`_.

            >>> rewriter = SpinRewriter('username', 'api_key')
        
            Request processed spun text with spintax.
            >>> rewriter.text_with_spintax(text)
            u"{This is|This really is|That is|This can be} some text that we'd {like to
            |prefer to|want to|love to} spin."
        
            Request a unique variation of processed given text.
            >>> rewriter.unique_variation(text)
