        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `gRaphaël`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`gRaphaël`: http://g.raphaeljs.com
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.graphael``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``graphael`` from ``js.graphael`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.graphael import graphael
          >>> graphael.need()
