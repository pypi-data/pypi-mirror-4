Description: TesseractTrainer
        ================
        by Balthazar Rouberol - Mor Consulting, rouberol.b@gmail.com
        
        TesseractTrainer is a simple Python API, taking over the tedious process of manually training Tesseract3,
        as described in the wiki page https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3.
        
        The longest part of the training process is checking the box file, generated by tesseract using a reference tif image,
        as explained at https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/TrainingTesseract3#Make_Box_Files.
        This file contains the coordinates of each character detected in the training tif. However, if Tesseract made some mistakes,
        you have to manually correct the boxfile, allowing Tesseract to "learn" from its mistakes.
        
        TesseractTrainer allows you to skip this part, by automatically generating a tif (and the associated boxfile) using a text
        and a font that you specify, thus guaranteeing the total accuracy of the box file.
        
        TesseractTrainer intends to provide both a python API and a bash command line tool.
