        ----------------------------------
        
        A content type, workflow and portlet for conducting online polls, both for
        anonymous and logged-in users.
        
        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        Features
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        - Polls can be opened for anonymous users to vote;
        - If an open poll is allowed for anonymous but is inside a private folder,
          nobody can vote. Therefore the poll's parent folder needs to be published
          before opening the poll in order for this field to take effect;
        - Voting can take place either in the object or in a voting portlet;
        - The voting portlet can show the latest open poll or ab specific open poll
          and closed polls;
        - Users can see partial results of the poll;
        - Results can be shown using a bar chart, a pie chart, or just by number of
          votes;
        - Polls can have relations with other content in the site.
        
        Workflow description
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The workflow associated with polls has the following states: Private, Pending
        review, Open and Closed.
        
        - Polls are created in Private state, so only Owner, Manager, Editor or Site
          Administrator roles can modify them);
        - When a poll is Private it can be sent to Pending review or directly to Open
          state, if the user has the proper role (Reviewer, Manager, Site
          Administrator);
        - When a poll is Pending review it can be edited by Manager, Editor, Reviewer
          or Site Administrator roles;
        - A poll in Pending review can be sent to Open, with "Review portal content"
          permission, or to Private, with "Request review" permission;
        - When the poll is Open people can only vote; nobody can modify the poll in
          any way;
        - An Open poll can be sent to Private or Closed state by Reviewer, Manager or
          Site Administrator roles;
        - When an Open poll is sent to Private, all votes are removed to avoid data
          manipulation;
        - When a poll is Closed nobody can modify it, nor can anyone vote on it; there
          is no way to reopen a closed poll.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.polls`` to the list of eggs to
           install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.polls
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.1 you may need to extend a Dexterity known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up Dexterity::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.polls'' and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.

          collective.panels.
