Testing out a really rough, semi-automated pagename geocode thing using the
LocalWiki API.

The idea is that you'd run this against a LocalWiki instance and it will add
maps to pages that don't have maps but have page names that look a lot like addresses.

This is really only useful for LocalWikis that were birthed from a legacy wiki
import or something where you've got lots of pages with addresses-for-pagenames
but no maps.

To install:

    $ pip install localwiki-geocode-pagenames

To run:

    $ localwiki-geocode-pagenames


Why?
----

This was thrown together when migrating ArborWiki.org from their old wiki
software.  They had a lot of pagenames like "34 South Parkside" but the pages
themselves lacked maps.
