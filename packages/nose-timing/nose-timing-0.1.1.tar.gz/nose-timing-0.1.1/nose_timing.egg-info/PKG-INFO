Description: A simple plugin that combines test times and test setup times and writes the
        output to JSON files. I ripped most of this out of nose-congestion:
        
        https://github.com/acdha/nose-congestion
        
        And added in a few bits for my own needs.
        
        This is a work in progress to do what I want and not much more at this point.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To install::
        
                pip install nose-timing
        
        When running your tests add::
        
                --with-timing
        
        To get your timing to run. By default it will write to your current directory
        two files, `setup.json` and `tests.json`. To alter where it writes to::
        
                --output-directory=/tmp
