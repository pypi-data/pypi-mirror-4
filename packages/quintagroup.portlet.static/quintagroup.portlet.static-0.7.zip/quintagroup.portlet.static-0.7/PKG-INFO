Description: quintagroup.portlet.static
        ==========================
        
        quintagroup.portlet.static is a Plone product that allows you to add stylished
        static text portlets to your Plone site. Static Stylish Text portlets are 
        usual Plone Static Text portlets with certain HTML classes assigned. 
        
        Static Stylish Text portlets can be used in those cases when you need to have
        several static text portlets be displayed in different ways. For this, 
        go to Site Setup -> Add-on Products Configuration -> Static Stylish portlet
        (www.yoursite/@@staticstylishportlet-controlpanel). In Static Stylish portlet
        settings area create HTML classes and specify CSS styles for those HTML 
        classes in the corresponding CSS file. These classes will be available for 
        you in a Portlet style drop down menu on static stylish text portlet add/edit form.
