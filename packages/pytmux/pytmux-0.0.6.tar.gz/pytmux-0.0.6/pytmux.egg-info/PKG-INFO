Description: pytmux
        ======
        
        This is a simple wrapper around tmux to allow you to define a session in a JSON
        file. This is to avoid having to do all the setup of making the session with a
        name, opening the windows with the right names and commands, and doing so in a
        consistent manner. Also, if the session already exists, it will just open it
        for you.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To list all configs::
        
          pytmux list
        
        To run a config::
        
          pytmux run <config>
        
        To start a new configuration or edit an existing one::
        
          pytmux edit <config>
        
        To validate all of your configs::
        
          pytmux doctor
        
        Configs
        -------
        
        JSON will be used for configs::
        
          {
              "name": "sample",
              "windows": [
                  {
                      "name": "dev server",
                      "command": "./manage.py runserver"
                  }, {
                      "name": "some shell"
                  }, {
                      "command": "emacs"
                  }, {}
              ]
          }
        
        Will open a tmux session named ``sample`` with 4 windows open. The first will
        be named ``dev server`` and will have ``./manage.py runserver`` running in
        it. The second will be a window named ``some shell`` which will have the system
        default shell running in it. The third will default to using
        ``automatic-rename`` and will have ``emacs`` running in it. The final will be a
        window with ``automatic-rename`` and the system default shell.
        
        Why
        ---
        
        Honestly, I don't want to build this, but none of the currently existing tmux
        wrappers seem interested in supporting not naming windows and letting tmux do
        its ``automatic-rename`` thing. Also they use YAML and I prefer JSON.
        
        Prior Art
        ---------
        
        There are a couple that exist already but don't make me happy.
