        c2.search.fuzzy Installation
        ===================================
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``c2.search.fuzzy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                c2.search.fuzzy
        
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                c2.search.fuzzy
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
            $ ./bin/buildout -N
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
