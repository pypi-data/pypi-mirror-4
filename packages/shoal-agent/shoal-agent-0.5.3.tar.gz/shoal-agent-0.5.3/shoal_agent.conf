#
# A sample configuration file to shoal agent.
#

[general]

# interval: the interval at which the shoal-agent will contact the shoal server
# in seconds. The default value is 30 seconds.
interval = 30

# cloud: an arbitrary string that can be used to indicate a logical group
# this squid server belongs to. It can safely be left blank.
cloud = ''

# external_ip: This value is used in the case where the squid has a private
# address only. It should be set to the public ip of the NAT gateway used to
# reach the squid server. This information allows the Shoal server to determine a
# rough geographic location for the privately addressed squid for matching
# purposes. The default is blank.  
external_ip = 

# squid_port: the port used by the squid server. Defaults to port 3128
squid_port = 3128

# tx_bytes_path: The system file which is used to generate network load
# statistics which are sent to the Shoal server. Typically the path to the file
# is: 
#     /sys/class/net/<NIC>/statistics/tx_bytes 
# where <NIC> is the interface you wish to monitor (i.e. eth0).
# This value must be set, there is no default.
#
#tx_bytes_path = /sys/class/net/eth0/statistics/tx_bytes

[rabbitmq]
# Shoal agent talks to the shoal server using the AMQP protocol. This section
# configures the communication with the AMQP server. In order to get a working
# setup you will likely have to change amqp_server_url below.

# amqp_server_url: RabbitMQ Server connection string. The format for this is:
#    amqp://username:pasword@hostname:port
# The default is the localhost on the default RabbitMQ port. This assumes
# that you are running the AMQP server on the same machine as the shoal agent,
# a most unlikely thing to do unless for testing purposes. You will likely have
# to change this config option to get a working setup
amqp_server_url = amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672

# amqp_virtual_host: RabbitMQ virtual host. This can typically be safely left
# as the default '/'.
amqp_virtual_host = /

# amqp_exchange_name: RabbitMQ exchange name. Default is shoal.
amqp_exchange = shoal

# amqp_exchange_type:  RabbitMQ exchange type. Possible options are: topic,
# direct, fanout. Default is topic.
amqp_exchange_type = topic

[logging]
# Configurations specific to webpy server

# log_file: path to the log file
#
log_file = /var/log/shoal_agent.log
