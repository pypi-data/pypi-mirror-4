        Clears the junk out of your CSS but finding out which selectors are
        actually not used in your HTML.
        
        By Peter Bengtsson, 2012-2013
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        With the onslaught of Twitter Bootstrap upon the world it's very
        tempting to just download their whole fat 80+Kb CSS and serve it up
        even though you're not using half of the HTML that it styles.
        
        There's also the case of websites that have changed over time but
        without the CSS getting the same amount of love refactoring. Then it's
        very likely that you get CSS selectors that you're no longer or never
        using.
        
        This tool can help you get started reducing all those selectors that
        you're not using.
        
        Whitespace compression?
        -----------------------
        
        No, that's a separate concern. This tool works independent of
        whitespace compression/optimization.
        
        For example, if you have a build step or a runtime step that converts
        all your CSS files into one (concatenation) and trims away all the
        excess whitespace (compression) then the output CSS can still contain
        selectors that are never actually used.
        
        What about AJAX?
        ----------------
        
        If you have a script that creates DOM elements in some sort of
        ``window.onload`` event then ``mincss`` will not be able to know this
        because at the moment ``mincss`` is entirely static.
        
        So what is a web developer to do? Simple, use ``/* no mincss */`` like
        this for example:
        
            .logged-in-info {
                /* no mincss */
        	color: pink;
            }
        
        That tells ``mincss`` to ignore the whole block and all its selectors.
