## PyUnio, A Python Implementation of Tezel's unio

__PyUnio is currently in alpha and should not be considered stable.__

### What

PyUnio is a rewrite of Tolga Tezel's [unio](https://github.com/ttezel/unio) (a Node.js solution) in Python.

_Keep in mind that PyUnio may not implement every feature of unio, but at the same time, it may implement more._

Any `specs` should be downloaded from Tezel's original repository and placed in the `specs` directory in the same file as `pyunio.py`.

### Implementations

Node.js:

* [unio](https://github.com/ttezel/unio) by Tolga Tezel (@ttezel)
	
Python:
	
* [PyUnio](https://github.com/citruspi/PyUnio) by Mihir Singh (@citruspi)

### Install

Either

    python setup.py
    
or

	pip install pyunio
	
followed by

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	
### Usage

The following code is an implementation of Twitter's API with PyUnio:

	from pyunio import pyunio
	
	params = {
				'consumer_secret'    : 'ITS A SECRET',
				'consumer_key'       : 'ITS A SECRET',
				'access_token'       : 'ITS A SECRET',
				'access_token_secret': 'ITS A SECRET'
			 }
	
	pyunio.use('twitter')
	
	result, error = pyunio.get('account/settings', params)
	
	print result.text


The output of `result.text` is

> {"protected":false,"geo_enabled":false,"screen_name":"citrus","language":"en","time_zone":{"tzinfo_name":"America\/Halifax","name":"Atlantic Time (Canada)","utc_offset":-14400},"discoverable_by_email":false,"sleep_time":{"enabled":false,"start_time":null,"end_time":null},"use_cookie_personalization":false,"always_use_https":true}

This can then be loaded and parsed via Python's `JSON` module.

### API

Coming Soon.
