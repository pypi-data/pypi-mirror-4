.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device. The customer
gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection (compared to the VPN
gateway, which is the device at the AWS side of the VPN connection). You can
have a single active customer gateway per AWS account (active means that you\(aqve
created a VPN connection to use with the customer gateway). AWS might delete any
customer gateway that you create with this operation if you leave it inactive
for an extended period of time.
.sp
You must provide the Internet\-routable IP address of the customer gateway\(aqs
external interface. The IP address must be static.
.sp
You must also provide the device\(aqs Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous
System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned to your network. If
you don\(aqt have an ASN already, you can use a private ASN (in the 64512 \- 65534
range). For more information about ASNs, go to
\fI\%http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29\fP .
