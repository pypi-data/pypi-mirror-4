About the project
=================

This project was part of my work realised for the MPRI 1-21 **net programming lesson**.
The MPRI is the **Parisian Master for Research in Computer Science** (*Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique* in French).

About the doc
=============
 
The documentation is produced mainly with **Sphinx**, the Python's documentation generator.
 
I wrote a few scripts to help *Sphinx* to do what I wanted, and to generate a *PyDoc* version of the doc too.
 
Those scripts constitute now an independant and a powerful project.
It is hosted [here on my Google Site](https://sites.google.com/site/naereencorp/liste-des-projets/makepydoc "check this out too ;) !")
