upload-signing-certificate
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the
specified user. Some AWS services use X.509 signing certificates to
validate requests that are signed with a corresponding private key.
When you upload the certificate, its default status is "Active" .

If the "--user-name" field is not specified, the user name is
determined implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID used to sign the
request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, this API can be used to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.

Note: Because the body of a X.509 certificate can be large, you should use
  POST rather than GET when calling "upload-signing-certificate" . For
  information about setting up signatures and authorization through
  the API, go to Signing AWS API Requests in the *AWS General
  Reference* . For general information about using the Query API with
  IAM, go to >>`<<Making Query Requests < http://docs.amazonwebservice
  s.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html> >>`<<_ in *Using
  IAM* .
