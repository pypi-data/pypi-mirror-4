Description: Logya README
        ============
        
        Logya is a static Web site generator written in Python designed to be easy
        to use and flexible.
        
        Please see the `documentation`_ for more information on how to use logya for creating Web sites.
        
        Logya Source Directory Structure

            * sites     barebone example Web sites

        Known issues in 2.1
        ----------------------
        
        * version number in 2 places setup.py and logya.version

        Roadmap
        -------
        
        Version 2.2
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * additional indexes as setting in site.cfg indexes=['language', 'tool'] parse them in docparser, names of indexes should not be used as directory names too ALTERNATIVE specify tags like tools/d3/ which works already, but creates 2 indexes one in tools/ and one in tools/d3/
        * add env var in config to set the evironment, if env is set to `dev` additional values will be read fom site_dev.cfg and override existing ones
        * make a useful tags index pages
        * make tags dir configurable in site.cfg?
        * minify and merge JS files, make this work in serve mode too!!!
            * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slimit/
            * http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/#can_it_aggregate_css_and_javascript
        * Refactor template var setting and getting, fixes are ugly
        * Inform users during generate when doc URL is used more the once
        
        Version 2.3
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Extensions API    http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/08/07/fundamental-concepts-of-plugin-infrastructures/
        * provide extension hooks in build_indexes and DocParser
        * options to enable and or disable extensions in site configuration
        * shared extensions .logya/ext
        
        Further Plans and Ideas
        -----------------------
        
        * Create content and templates for XML and HTML sitemaps in base site
        * Add `logya ext create EXTNAME` command
        * automatic description generation as parser extension
        * content snippets that are replaced when generating document
