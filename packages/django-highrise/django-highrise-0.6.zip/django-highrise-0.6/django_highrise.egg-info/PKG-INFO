Description: Django-Highrise
        ===============
        
        This app provides integration between Django and Highrise, which is used to
        provide CRM capabilities.
        
        Currently this supports only one operation - pushing a user to Highrise.
        
        It uses the `pyrise <https://github.com/feedmagnet/pyrise>`_ library from `Jason
        Ford <https://github.com/jasford>`_.
        
        Why bother?
        -----------
        
        Django is a great web app framework, it's not such a good CRM tool. Sometimes
        you need a little bit extra. Highrise is a simple CRM product from the guys
        behind Basecamp. It allows you to keep tabs on contacts (amongst a lot of
        other sales-related stuff), and has a great email integration feature. You can
        read more about it at http://highrisehq.com/signup.
        
        Tell me more
        ------------
        
        This app simplifies the process of integrating with Highrise. It provides the
        API hooks to allow you to push django user records into Highrise, and to read
        a Highrise contact's feed (notes, emails, comments) back out. Where and when
        you use these hooks is up to you. It could be at the point of user registration,
        it could be through the Django admin site, it could even be from the command
        line, run as a batch job overnight.
        
        Under the hood django-highrise is a wrapper around **pyrise**, and so the
        objects returned are standard pyrise Person, Note, Email objects. This allows
        you to use them in your own code, for instance for adding additional attributes
        beyond just the core User attributes.
        
        The app comes with a single model - HighriseContact. This is used to track
        the fact that a User has been synced with Highrise, and to contain some basic
        utility attributes that make further integration easier.
        
        Network considerations
        ----------------------
        
        It is very important to bear in mind that this app makes a number of calls
        across the public internet, and is therefore neither highly performant, nor
        immune to standard network connectivity issues. It should *not* therefore be
        integrated in any area of your application where an unexpected 30s network
        timeout would cause a problem. i.e. do not include this as a synchronous call
        in your registration process.
        
        When you sync a User to Highrise two network calls take place: first, a GET is
        issued to the API to fetch any possible matches, then, if none are found, a
        POST is issued to push the new contact to the API. If you wanted to add further
        attributes to the Person and save those back to Highrise, that would be three
        network calls. **Caveat emptor**.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The underlying **pyrise** library requires a server URL and a valid API key.
        These are set by the app when calling the ``init()`` function.
        
        The server setting is the URL to your instance of Highrise - e.g.
        **example.highrisehq.com**. Highrise API keys are specific to an individual
        user - and are available in your account under the 'My info' section.
        
        You can use the ``test_me()`` method to validate your credentials::
        
            >>> from django_highrise import init, test_me
            >>> init('example.highrisehq.com', '1234567890')
            >>> test_me()
            True
            >>>
        
        NB You must call ``init()`` before using the ``sync_user()`` function; an
        exception of type HighriseSyncException will be raised if you do not do so.
        
        Easiest option is to call ``init()`` in your **settings.py** file.
        
        Show me some code
        -----------------
        
        Initialise Highrise connection::
        
            >>> from django.conf import settings
            >>> from django_highrise import init, test_me
            >>> init(settings.HIGHRISE_SERVER, settings.HIGHRISE_API_KEY)
            >>> test_me()
            True
            >>>
        
        Push a django user to Highrise::
        
            >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
            >>> user = User.objects.create_user('bob', 'bob@example.com', 'password')
            >>> from django_highrise import sync_user
            >>> contact = sync(user)
            >>> contact
            <HighriseContact: bob = 1234567>
            >>>
        
        Update a person in Highrise from django::
        
            >>> contact.person.title = "CEO"
            >>> contact.save()
        
        Fetch the notes about a contact from Highrise::
        
            >>> for note in contact.person.notes:
            ...   print note.body
            ...
            This is a note
            This is another note
            >>>
        
        Get the Highrise URL for the contact::
        
            >>> print contact.url
            'https://example.highrisehq.com/people/1234567'
            >>>
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        There is a test suite, and a test_settings.py file that is (I think) the
        smallest I could get away with and still run the tests. It includes DATABASES,
        INSTALLED_APPS and LOGGING (because django_highrise logs error using logging).
        The database setting is for sqlite3, so no additional software is required.
        
        The repository includes a modified manage.py and test_settings.py that enable
        the tests to be run in isolation (i.e. you could download the source repo and
        run the tests direct from the command line using ``python manage.py test``).
        These files are *not* included in the package, as it is assumed that the app
        will be used within the context of an existing Django site, in which case the
        site settings would suffice.
