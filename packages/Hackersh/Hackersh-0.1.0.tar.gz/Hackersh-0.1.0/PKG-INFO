        Hello, world
        ------------
        
        Here is the canonical "Hello, world" example program in Hackersh::
        
        	"http://localhost" -> url -> nmap -> w3af
        
        Wait, what? This is a a compacted but 100% complete implementation of a black-box web application vulnerability scanner
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        There are a few ways to install Hackersh.
        
        1. You can install directly from PyPI_ using ``easy_install`` or pip_::
        
                easy_install hackersh
        
           or::
        
                pip install hackersh
        
        2. You can clone the git repository somewhere in your system::
        
                git clone git://github.com/ikotler/hackersh.git
        
           Then you should do following steps::
        
                cd hackersh
                python setup.py install
        
           Alternatively, if you use pip_, you can install directly from the git repository::
        
                pip install \
                	git+git://github.com/ikotler/hackersh.git@master#egg=Hackersh \
        		-r https://github.com/ikotler/hackersh/raw/master/doc/requirements.txt
        
        For any of the above methods, if you want to do a system-wide installation, you will have to do this with *root* permissions (e.g. using ``su`` or ``sudo``).
