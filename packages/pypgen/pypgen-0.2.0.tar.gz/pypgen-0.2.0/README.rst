Welcome to Pypgen (v0.2.0) *BETA*
---------------------------------

Pypgen provides various utilities for estimating standard genetic
diversity measures including Gst, G'st, G''st, and Jost's D from large
genomic datasets (Hedrick, 2005; Jost, 2008; Masatoshi Nei, 1973; Nei &
Chesser, 1983). Pypgen operates both on the level of individual SNPs as
well as on user defined regions (e.g., five kilobase windows tiled
across each chromosome). For the windowed analyses, pypgen estimates the
multi-locus versions of each estimators.

Features:
~~~~~~~~~

-  Operates on standard `VCF (Variant Call
   Format) <http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41>`_
   formatted SNP calls
-  Uses `bgziped <http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tabix.shtml>`_ input
   for fast random access
-  Takes advantage of multiple processor cores
-  Handles multiallelic SNP calls
-  Allows a single VCF file to contain multiple populations
-  Calculates additional metrics:

   -  snp count per window
   -  mean read depth (+/- STDEV) per window

   -  populations with fixed alleles per SNP
   -  more as I think of them

Important Note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PYPGEN IS STILL IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND ALMOST CERTAINLY CONTAINS
BUGS. If you find a bug please file a report in the 'issues' section of
this repository and I'll address it as soon as I can.

Enclosed Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Sliding window analysis (vcf\_sliding\_window.py)
-  Per SNP analysis (vcf\_snpwise\_fstats.py)

Dependancies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  OSX or Linux
-  `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/>`_
-  `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
-  `pysam <http://wwwfgu.anat.ox.ac.uk/~andreas/documentation/samtools/contents.html>`_
   and `samtools <http://samtools.sourceforge.net/>`_

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


First install the dependancies. I like to use
`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ for this purpose. If running on
OS X I recommend using `homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_ to
install samtools, requirement of pysam, prior to installing pysam. Once
the dependancies are installed clone this repository:

::

        pip install pygen

::

        git clone git@github.com:ngcrawford/pypgen.git

You should be able to run the UnitTests without any problems:

::

        python tests/tests.py

or, install and run nose:

::

        pip install nose
        nosetests

Infomation about each script can be obtained by running:

::

        python [script name].py -h

Output: (note this will probably change)
