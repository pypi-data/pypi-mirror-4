Description: MenuNavigation lets you add HTML descriptions to objects in Plone.
        
        Add a new HTML-description by selecting MenuPage from the "Add new..."
        Menu. The Title is automatically generated, and the Content-field
        takes HTML or text. (It is added with tal:replace structure)
        
        You can add portlets to show the HTML-description:
            Add a Classic Portlet with the following settings:
        
                Template: info_portlet
            	Macro: portlet
        
        The portlet searches through context for a MenuPage, if none are found
        it searches all the parents of context until site-root, and returns
        the first MenuPage it finds. Site-root is not searched, and can not
        use the portlet. If no menupages are found, the portlet displays
        nothing.
        
        1.0b1
        
          Making product compatible with GenericSetup only, to ensure that
          conflicts with for example TinyMCE on skins aren't an issue.
        
          Adding example template for adding MenuNavigation info to
          webcouturier.dropdownmenu.
