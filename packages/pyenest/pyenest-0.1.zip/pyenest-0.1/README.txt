 Usage:
    'nest.py' can be used from the command line exactly as before.
    It can also be imported and used programmatically, either exactly as Scott's version,
    or by passing parameters identifying specific structures and devices for setups where
    you have multiples or want to be agnostic.

 Example:
    'nest.py --user joe@user.com --password swordfish temp 73'
         set the temperature to 73 degrees

    'nest.py --user joe@user.com --password swordfish fan auto'
         set the fan to automatic

 Installation:
    'python ./setup.py install' will install nest.py to the right place,
    usually your /usr/bin directory.

 Acknowledgements:
    Chris Burris's Siri Nest Proxy was very helpful to learn the nest's
       authentication and some bits of the protocol.
    Scott Baker's nest.py, which I (Eugene Efremov) shamelessly bastardized, was irreplaceable
       and without it I likely wouldn't have done any of this.
