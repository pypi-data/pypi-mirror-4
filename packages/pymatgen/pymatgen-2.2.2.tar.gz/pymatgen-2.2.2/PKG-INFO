Description: 
        Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) is a robust, open-source Python library
        for materials analysis. It currently powers the public Materials Project
        (http://www.materialsproject.org), an initiative to make calculated properties
        on a large number of materials available to materials researchers and
        designers. These are some of the main features:
        1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of Element, Site, Molecule,
           Structure objects.
        2. Extensive io capabilities to manipulate many VASP input and output files
           (http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/) and the crystallographic information
           file format. This includes generating Structure objects from vasp input and
           output. There is also support for Gaussian input files and XYZ file for
           molecules.
        3. Comprehensive tool to generate and view compositional and grand canonical
           phase diagrams.
        4. Electronic structure analyses (DOS and Bandstructure).
        5. Integration with the Materials Project REST API.
        The pymatgen library is free (as in free beer) to download and to use.
        However, we would also like you to help us improve this library by making your
        own contributions as well.  These contributions can be in the form of
        additional tools or modules you develop, or even simple things such as bug
        reports. Please contact the maintainer of this library (shyue@mit.edu) to find
        out how to include your contributions via github or for bug reports.
        Note that pymatgen, like all scientific research, will always be a work in
        progress. While the development team will always strive to avoid backward
        incompatible changes, they are sometimes unavoidable, and tough decisions have
        to be made for the long term health of the code.
        For documentation and usage guide, please refer to the latest documentation at
        our github page (http://materialsproject.github.com/pymatgen/). If you wish to
        be notified via email of pymatgen releases, you may become a member of
