Description: ssbench
        =======
        
        A benchmarking suite for the OpenStack Swift object storage system.
        
        The ``ssbench-master run-scenario`` command will run benchmark "scenarios"
        against an
        OpenStack Swift cluster, utilizing one or more distributed ``ssbench-worker``
        processes, saving statistics about the run to a file.  The ``ssbench-master
        report-scenario`` command can then generate a
        report from the saved statstics.  By default, ``ssbench-master run-scenario``
        will generate a report to STDOUT immediately following a benchmark run in
        addition to saving the raw results to a file.
        
        Coordination between the ``ssbench-master`` and one or more ``ssbench-worker``
        processes is managed through a pair of `PyZMQ`_ sockets.  This
        allows ``ssbench-master`` to distribute the benchmark run across many, many
        client servers while still coordinating the entire run (each worker can be
        given a job referencing an object created by a different worker).

        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``ssbench`` has been developed for and tested with Python 2.7 (Python 2.6 is
        known to be broken, but Issue #29 calls for this to be fixed).
        
        You will first need to make sure Python native extension building works and
        install `libevent`_, which is required by ``gevent``.
        
        I apologize for this stupid dependency dance with Ubuntu (tested with **12.04
        LTS Precise**).  With the --noop benchmark, ``gevent-zeromq`` is about 25%
        faster than ``pyzmq`` 2.2.0.1's zmq.green module.  The ``gevent-zeormq``
        Cython build doesn't work with Ubuntu 12.04's Python's distribute, and Cython
        has to be installed in a prior "pip" command to be recognized by
        ``gevent-zeromq``'s setup.py.::
        
          $ sudo apt-get install -y python-dev python-pip 'g++' libzmq-dev libevent-dev
          $ sudo pip install --upgrade distribute
          $ sudo pip install Cython gevent pyzmq==2.2.0
          $ sudo pip install ssbench
        
        On CentOS 6.3, here are some starter instructions.  Because CentOS' system
        Python is still 2.6, this won't actually work until ``ssbench`` is made
        compatible with Python 2.6 (for starters, ``logging.captureWarnings`` isn't
        present in 2.6, apparently).::
        
          $ sudo rpm -Uvh http://mirror.pnl.gov/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
          $ sudo yum install -y gcc python-setuptools python-devel libevent-devel
          $ sudo easy_install pip            (might be available through EPEL as python-pip)
          $ sudo pip install argparse
          $ sudo pip install ssbench
          (Note that at this point you'll be using Python 2.6 which won't actuall work
          with ssbench)
        
        On the Mac, Python 2.7 and `libevent`_ may be installed with `Homebrew`_.  I
        haven't tested a fresh install in a while, but I had far less problems with
        Cython and gevent-zeormq on OS X, probably because the `Homebrew`_ Python was
        newer than Ubuntu 12.04's?
        
        I have not tested ``ssbench`` against
        gevent v1.x, but according to an old `gevent blog post`_, gevent v1.x will
        bundle `libev`_ and not require the installation of `libevent`_ or
        `libev_`.  If you try ``ssbench`` with gevent 1.x, please let me know how that
        goes...
        
        Once the above system dependencies have been satisfied, you may install
        this module (``ssbench``) and its Python module dependencies via pip.  The
        pyzmq package will use its bundled ZMQ if your system doesn't have the
        library installed.
        
        You will also need an `OpenStack Swift`_ cluster to benchmark.

        Scenarios
        ---------
        
        A "scenario" (sometimes called a "CRUD scenario") is a utf8-encoded JSON file
        defining a benchmark run.  Specifically, it defines:
        
        - A ``name`` for the scenario (an arbitrary string)
        - A ``sizes`` list of "object size" classes.  Each object size class has a
          ``name``, a ``size_min`` minimum object size, a ``size_max`` maximum object
          size (in bytes), and an
          optional ``crud_profile`` for just this size.  If ``crud_profile`` is not
          given for a size, the top-level ``crud_profile`` will be used.  The
          ``crud_profile`` here is just like the top-level one, an array of 4 numbers
          whose relative sizes determine the percent chance of a Create, Read, Update,
          or Delete operation.  Objects created or updated within an object size
          class will have a size (in bytes) chosen at random uniformly between the
          minimum and maximum sizes.
        - An ``initial_files`` dictionary of initial file-counts per size class.  Each
          size class can have zero or
          more objects uploaded *prior* to the benchmark run itself.  The proportion of
          initial files also defines the probability distribution of object sizes
          during the benchmark run itself.  So if a particular object size class is not
          included in ``initial_files`` or has a value of 0 in ``initial_files``, then
          no objects in that size class will be used during the benchmark run.
        - An ``operation_count`` of operations to perform during the benchmark run.
          An operation is
          either a CREATE, READ, UPDATE, or DELETE of an object.  This value may be
          overridden for any given run with the ``-o COUNT`` flag to ``ssbench-master
          run-scenario``.
        - A ``crud_profile`` which determines the distribution of each kind of operation.
          For instance, ``[3, 4, 2, 2]`` would mean 27% CREATE, 36% READ, 18% UPDATE,
          and 18% DELETE.
        - A ``user_count`` which determines the maxiumum client concurrency during the
          benchmark run.  The user is responsible for ensuring there are enough workers
          running to support the scenario's defined ``user_count``.  (Each
          ``ssbench-worker`` process uses gevent_ to achive very efficeint
          concurrency for the benchmark client requests.)  This value may be overridden
          for any given run with the ``-u COUNT`` flag to ``ssbench-master
          run-scenario``.
        - A ``container_count`` which determines how many Swift containers are used for
          the benchmark run.  This key is optional in the scenario file and defaults to
          100.  This value may be overridden for any given run with the ``-c
          COUNT`` flag to ``ssbench-master run-scenario``.
        - A ``container_concurrency`` value which determines the level of client
          concurrency used by ``ssbench-master`` to create the benchmark containers.
          This value is optional and defaults to 10.
        
        For each operation of the benchmark run, a size category is first chosen based
        on the relative counts for each size category in the ``initial_files``
        dictionary.  This probability for each size category appears under the "% Ops"
        column in the report.  Then an operation type is chosen based on that size
        category's CRUD profile (which can be individually specified or may be
        inherited from the "top level" CRUD profile).
        
        If each size category has its own CRUD profile, then the overall CRUD profile
        of the benchmark run will be a weighted average between the values in the "%
        Ops" column and the CRUD profile of each size category.  This weighted average
        CRUD profile is included in the report on the "CRUD weighted average" line.
        
        .. _gevent: http://www.gevent.org/
        
        ``ssbench`` comes with a few canned scenarios, but users are encouraged to
        experiment and define their own.
        
        Here is an example JSON scenario file::
        
          {
            "name": "Small test scenario",
            "sizes": [{
              "name": "tiny",
              "size_min": 4096,
              "size_max": 65536
            }, {
              "name": "small",
              "size_min": 100000,
              "size_max": 200000
            }],
            "initial_files": {
              "tiny": 100,
              "small": 10
            },
            "operation_count": 500,
            "crud_profile": [3, 4, 2, 2],
            "user_count": 7
          }
        
        **Beware:** hand-editing JSON is error-prone.  Watch out for trailing
        commas, in particular.

        HTTPS on OS X
        -------------
        
        On a Mac, using HTTPS, I got a significant speed-up when setting
        ``OPENSSL_X509_TEA_DISABLE=1`` in the environment of my ``ssbench-worker``
        processes.  I found this tip via a `curl blog post`_ after noticing a
        process named ``trustevaluationagent`` chewing up a lot of CPU during a
        benchmark run against a cluster using HTTPS.
        
        .. _`curl blog post`: http://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2011/11/05/apples-modified-ca-cert-handling-and-curl/
        
        Example Multi-Server Run
        ------------------------
        
        Start one or more ``ssbench-worker`` processes on each server (each
        ``ssbench-worker`` process defaults to a maximum gevent-based concurrency
        of 256, but the ``-c`` option can override that default).  Use the
        ``--zmq-host`` command-line parameter to specify the host on which you will run
        ``ssbench-master``.::
        
          bench-host-01$ ssbench-worker -c 1000 --zmq-host bench-host-01 1 &
          bench-host-01$ ssbench-worker -c 1000 --zmq-host bench-host-01 2 &
        
          bench-host-02$ ssbench-worker -c 1000 --zmq-host bench-host-01 3 &
          bench-host-02$ ssbench-worker -c 1000 --zmq-host bench-host-01 4 &
        
        Finally, run one ``ssbench-master`` process which will manage and coordinate
        the multi-server benchmark run::
        
          bench-host-01$ ssbench-master run-scenario -f scenarios/very_small.scenario -u 2000 -o 40000
        
        The above example would involve a total client concurrency of 2000, spread
        evenly among the four workers on two hosts (``bench-host-01`` and
        ``bench-host-02``).  The four workers, as started in the above example,
        could support a client concurrency up to 4000.
        
        
        Example Simple Single-Server Run
        --------------------------------
        
        If you only need workers running on the local host, you can do so with a single
        command.  Simply use the ``--workers COUNT`` option to ``ssbench-master``::
        
          $ ssbench-master run-scenario -f scenarios/very_small.scenario -u 4 -c 80 -o 613 --pctile 50 --workers 2

        The No-op Mode
        --------------
        
        To test the maximum throughput of the ``ssbench-master`` ==> ``beantalkd``
        ==> ``ssbench-worker`` infrastructure, you can add ``--noop`` to a
        ``ssbench-master run-scenario`` command and the scenario will be "run" but
        the ``ssbench-worker`` processes will not actually talk to the Swift cluster.
        
        In this manner, you may determine your maximum requests per second if talking
        to the Swift cluster were free.
        
        The reported "Average requests per second:" value in the "TOTAL" section of
        the report should be higher than you expect to get out of the Swift cluster
        itself.
        
        With an older version of ``ssbench`` which used a beanstalkd server to manage
        master/worker communication, my 2012 15" Retina Macbook Pro could get **~2,700
        requests per second** with ``--noop`` using a local beanstalkd, one
        ``ssbench-worker``, and a user count (concurrency) of 4.
        
        With ZeorMQ sockets (no beanstalkd involved), the same laptop can get between
        **7,000 and 8,000 requests per second** with ``--noop``.
