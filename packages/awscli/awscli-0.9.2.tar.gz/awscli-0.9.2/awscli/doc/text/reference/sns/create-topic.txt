create-topic
************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The create-topic action creates a topic to which notifications can be
published. Users can create at most 25 topics. This action is
idempotent, so if the requester already owns a topic with the
specified name, that topic's ARN will be returned without creating a
new topic.
