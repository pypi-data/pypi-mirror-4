create-snapshot
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation initiates a snapshot of a volume.

AWS Storage Gateway provides the ability to back up point-in-time
snapshots of your data to Amazon Simple Storage (S3) for durable off-
site recovery, as well as import the data to an Amazon Elastic Block
Store (EBS) volume in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). You can take
snapshots of your gateway volume on a scheduled or ad-hoc basis. This
API enables you to take ad-hoc snapshot. For more information, see
Working With Snapshots in the AWS Storage Gateway Console .

In the create-snapshot request you identify the volume by providing
its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must also provide description for
the snapshot. When AWS Storage Gateway takes the snapshot of specified
volume, the snapshot and description appears in the AWS Storage
Gateway Console. In response, AWS Storage Gateway returns you a
snapshot ID. You can use this snapshot ID to check the snapshot
progress or later use it when you want to create a volume from a
snapshot.

Note: To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For
  more information, go to DeleteSnapshot and DescribeSnapshots in the
  *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference* .
