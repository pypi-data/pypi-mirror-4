What is it?
===========

The Open Cooperative Web Framework enables the creation of *cooperative web
applications* featuring concurrent real-time interactions among remote users
and external data sources. The framework handles remote notification of user
changes, the resolution of conflicting changes, and convergence of application
state with minimal information from the application.

The current implementation of the framework is based on open web technologies
such as `AMD <http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition>`_,
`Bayeux <http://svn.cometd.com/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html>`_, and
`WebSockets <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets>`_. The framework includes:

* A JavaScript API for sending and receiving coweb events
* An JavaScript *operation engine* using `operational transformation
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation>`_ to ensure shared
  state convergence
* A Python coweb server built on the `Tornado <http://tornadowebserver.org>`_
  web framework
* A Java coweb server built on the `CometD <http://cometd.org>`_ Java library
* API documentation, tutorials, and examples

Getting Started
===============

Read the the framework documentation online at http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs. It
includes tutorials on how to obtain the coweb package from Maven Central or PyPI
and write your first cooperative web application. 

Send mail to the coweb users group or join us on IRC if you're having trouble.

Developer setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For developers seeking to develop this project directly, see
https://github.com/opencoweb/coweb/wiki/Developer-Setup.

Status
======

Tagged revisions in the *master* branch are our stable releases. The docs at
http://opencoweb.org/ocwdocs match the latest stable release.

The *opencoweb/coweb/master* branch on GitHub contains the framework code
progressing toward the next stable release. We increment the version number in
the code immediately after tagging a stable release so it reflects our next
intended stable version.

The *opencoweb/cowebx/master* branch on GitHub contains example applications
and widgets using the framework. We do not plan to make stable releases of the
examples. Instead we will attempt to keep them working with all versions of the
framework version 0.4 or higher.

All APIs are subject to change until we hit a v1.0 milestone.

Support
=======

Currently, the JavaScript portions of the coweb framework should work in the
following browsers.

* Firefox 3.5+
* Safari 4+
* Chrome
* IE8+
* Opera 10.50+
* Mobile Safari on iOS 4+
* Android Browser 1.6+

For our Java coweb server, we support any environment that can run a Java
Servlet 3.0 compliant container (e.g., Jetty, Tomcat). For the Python server,
we support any environment where Tornado can operate.

Please report an issue on GitHub if you have trouble in one of these browsers or
server environments.
