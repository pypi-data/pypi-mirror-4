Overview
========

Piston mini client is a package that allows you to easily describe an
API provided by a Django server using django-piston that takes care of:

* Serializing call arguments and deserializing responses from the api.  It
  can deserialize json provided by Piston into light-weight objects.
* Making the http calls for you.  You should be able to call a method on an
  api object instead of having to fetch a particular URL.
* Provide a in-code description of your API.  Developers should be able to
  know your API by looking at the client code you provide.

You can read the `latest docs online`_.
