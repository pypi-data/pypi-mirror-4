        =======
        
        Pantera is a tool to test the resilience of cloud applications. It's based on
        EC2 instances, and process management. It's able to destroy, stop and reboot
        instances, and also able to kill process locally and remotely.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pantera
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First open the interactive python shell:
        
        ::
        
            $ python
        
        Then:
        
        ::
        
            >>> from pantera import random_run
            >>> random_run("ec2-access-key", "ec2-secret-key")
        
        This will run a random action, using the given parameters.

            >>> run("terminate", "ec2-access-key", "ec2-secret-key")
        
        To check the list of available actions:
        
        ::
