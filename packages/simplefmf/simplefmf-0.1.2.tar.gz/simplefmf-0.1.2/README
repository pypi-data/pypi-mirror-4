simplefmf is a small module to write full metadata format
(fmfi) files. It is easy to use and gives a very lightwight
way to write fmf files as described in
http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.1299.

Since simplefmf is simple it does only provide very small
sanity and syntax checks. So it is up to you to write
propper fmf files.
