Description: whack: build and install binaries with a single command
        =======================================================
        
        Whack allows binaries such as nginx and node.js to be installed with a
        single command. For instance, to install nginx 1.2.5 to
        ``~/apps/nginx``:
        
        ::
        
            whack install git+https://github.com/mwilliamson/whack-package-nginx.git \
                -pversion=1.2.5 ~/apps/nginx
        
        Where possible, the build of each application will be relocatable. On
        the first installation, the application is compiled and copied to the
        target directory. On subsequent installations, a cached version of the
        application is copied to the target directory.
