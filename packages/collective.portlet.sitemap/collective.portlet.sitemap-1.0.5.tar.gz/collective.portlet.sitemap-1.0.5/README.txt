Introduction
============

This portlet can replace standard plone navigation portlet.

The difference is :

By default the navigation is displayed as a sitemap with a 2 level sitemap depth.

If you disable the option "display as site map" in portlet edit form, you will retrieve the standard
plone navigation behavior.
