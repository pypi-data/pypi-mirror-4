Hi ${user.first_name}

Yith Library sends you your passwords collection just in case something goes wrong with our servers.

You can use the attached file to import your passwords collection into a Yith Library server using the "Backup" menu inside your account. Here you have a quick link: ${backups_link}

You are receiving this email because the preference "Send my passwords to my email monthly" is set.

If you don't want to receive these mails anymore you can unset that preference at: ${preferences_link}
