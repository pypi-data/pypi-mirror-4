        =============
        
        Catalog changes
        ---------------
        
        After installing this product, the catalog of your Plone site will be populated with a new index and a metadata
        column: the ``Modifier``.
        This will be the last user who performed a content change (both editing review state change).
        
        Other products can start using this index for performing special searches.
        
        Expand the document byline section
        ----------------------------------
        
        Optionally, this new information can be added to the content's view.

           :alt: Document byline preview
        
        To enable this you need to access ZMI and change the new ``displayLastModifierInByline`` property for the
        ``site_properties`` property sheet, checking it.
        
        Please, note that this will also works for the new-style byline, that can also display the publication
        date (see PLIP `#8699`__):

           :alt: Document byline preview in the Plone 4.3 style
        
        In facts, this can backport the publication date feature to older Plone versions (but this is a side effect of
        the product, not a wanted feature).
        
        When the new byline information is used?
        ----------------------------------------
        
        * ``displayLastModifierInByline`` must be true.
        * *Creator* and *Modifier* must be not equals (just for not show a duplicate link).
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add ``rt.lastmodifier`` to your buildout:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs=
               ...
               rt.lastmodifier
        
        After that, install the "rt.lastmodifier" add-on product.
        
        .. Note::
            Installation wil trigger the new index creation and population. This can require some times
            on huge sites.

        =========
        
        0.2 (2013-04-17)
        ----------------
        
        * Renamed the product from "collective.lastmodifier" to "rt.lastmodifier".
          This is unbelievable and embarassing, but I didn't find `collective.lastmodifier`__ when I looked for
          a Plone product with those features... and in the end I choosed the same name!
        
          __ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.lastmodifier
        
          However the original product is using a different approach.
        * Added collection criteria (for new and old ones)
