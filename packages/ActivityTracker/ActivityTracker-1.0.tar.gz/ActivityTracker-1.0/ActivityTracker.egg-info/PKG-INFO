        ActivityTracker
        ===============
        
        A tool for querying various sources to see what time was worked on specific
        tasks.  Contains various plugins for Tomboy notes and text files.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        The basic workflow with ActivityTracker is to define a "group" of
        files that contain time-based task intervals in some format.  At
        the moment, ActivityTracker comes with three different parsers:
        
          1. Emacs OrgMode_ files
          2. Tomboy notes
          3. Plain text files
        
        Setting Up
        ----------
        
          1. Create a new directory, ``/home/myhomedir/.activitytracker``
          2. Setup a new file, ``/home/myhomedir/.activitytracker/config.ini``
          3. Add group entries to ``config.ini``
        
        OrgMode_
        --------
        
        An entry for a group of OrgMode_ files looks like this::
        
          [File Group: Emacs OrgMode Files]
          base_dir = /somedir/org-files
          filename_match = [-_a-zA-Z0-9]*[.]org$
          parser_name = activitytracker.plugins.orgmode.EmacsOrgModeParser
        
        Please see the OrgMode_ home page for specifics on the OrgMode_
        format.  ActivityTracker's OrgMode parser has two requirements:
        
          1. Headings meant to be recorded/queried should have the **book** tag
          2. The second line after a heading with **book** tag should have a
             timestamp indicating the length of time worked
        
        Here is an example entry:
        
          ** ActivityTracker :book:
          <2011-04-16 Sat 10:00-14:00>
          Working on orgmode support
        
        Tomboy
        ------
        
        An entry for a group of Tomboy_ notes on a recent Gnome configuration
        would look like this:
        
          [File Group: Tomboy Notes]
          base_dir = /home/myhomedir/.local/share/tomboy
          filename_match = [a-zA-Z-0-9]*?[.]note
          parser_name = activitytracker.plugins.tomboy.TomboyFileParser
        
        Plain Text Files
        ----------------
        
        An entry for a group of plain text files would look like this:
        
          [File Group: Legacy Journal Files]
          base_dir = /home/myhomedir/Documents/journal
          filename_match = month-[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9]+[.]txt$
          parser_name = activitytracker.plugins.text.TextFileParser

        .. _Tomboy: http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/?pagewanted=all
        
        Writing Plugins
        ===============
        
        The ActivityTracker plugin mechanism expects a *callable* to
        be named as the ``parser_name`` value in a file entry group.
        
        While checking files, the *callable* will be invoked (with no
        arguments).  The *callable* must return an object with a
        ``parse_input`` function.  The ``parse_input`` function
        will be invoked for every file matching the criteria.
        
        After ``parse_input`` is invoked at least once, the object must
        ensure it has a ``projects`` attribute as an iterable of
        *Project* instances.
