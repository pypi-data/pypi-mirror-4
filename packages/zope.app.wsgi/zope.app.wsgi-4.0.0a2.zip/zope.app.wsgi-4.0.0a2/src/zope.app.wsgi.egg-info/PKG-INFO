Description: This package provides the ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` class which
        exposes the object publishing machinery in ``zope.publisher`` as a
        WSGI application.  It also lets us bring up the Zope application
        server (parsing ``zope.conf`` and ``site.zcml``) with a mere function
        call::
        
            >>> db = zope.app.wsgi.config('zope.conf')
        
        This is especially useful for debugging.
        
        To bring up Zope and obtain the WSGI application object at the same
        time, use the ``getWSGIApplication`` function.
        
        This package also provides an easy to use application factory for
        PasteDeploy_. You can simply specify an application configuration
        like this in your Paste configuration file::
        
            [app:main]
            use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
            config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
        
        Look for more documentation inside the package itself.

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        4.0.0a2 (2013-03-02)
        --------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug in WSGI Test Layer setup, where the DB is not correctly set.
        
        
        4.0.0a1 (2013-02-28)
        --------------------
        
        - Added support for Python 3.3.
        
        - Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
          ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.
        
        - Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.
        
        
        3.15.0 (2012-01-19)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed: zope.app.wsgi.paste.ZopeApplication didn't emit
          ProcessStarting events.
        
          **NOTE**
            If an application compensated for this by generating the event, it
            will need to stop or there will be multiple events
            emited. (Whether or not multiple events will do any harm is
            application specific.)
        
        3.14.0 (2012-01-10)
        -------------------
        
        - Set the WSGI environment's ``REMOTE_USER`` item (if not already set)
          with the Zope principal label. (This is the same data set in
          the ``wsgi.logging_info`` environment item.)
        
          This change allows user info to be used by `paste.translogger
          <http://pythonpaste.org/modules/translogger.html>`_ middleware (or
          any similar middleware that uses ``REMOTE_USER``), which provides
          access logging.
        
        
        3.13.0 (2011-03-15)
        -------------------
        
        - Update to zope.testbrowser 4.0.0 which uses WebTest instead of wsgi_intercept.
        
        
        3.12.0 (2011-01-25)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http`` to work with changes made in
          version 3.11.0.
        
        
        3.11.0 (2011-01-24)
        -------------------
        
        - Moved `wsgi_intercept` support to ``zope.testbrowser.wsgi``, thus
          requiring at least version 3.11 of this package:
        
          - Moved ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.Browser`` to
            ``zope.testbrowser.wsgi.Browser``, but left BBB import here.
        
          - Split up ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.BrowserLayer`` into generic WSGI
            browser layer (``zope.testbrowser.wsgi.Layer``) and ZODB/ZOPE specific
            part (``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.BrowserLayer`` as before).
        
        
        3.10.0 (2010-11-18)
        -------------------
        
        - Add pluggability for setting up WSGI middleware in testlayer.
        
        
        3.9.3 (2010-10-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Python 2.7 compatibility for xmlrpc. Transplant of zope.app.testing r116141.
        
        
        3.9.2 (2010-05-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed test breakage due to changes in mechanize 0.2.0.
        
        
        3.9.1 (2010-04-24)
        ------------------
        
        - Add support for testing XMLRPC using zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.
        
        - Fix a bug in the status string handling in zope.app.wsgi.testlayer's
          FakeResponse.
        
        
        3.9.0 (2010-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Return a FakeResponse object in zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http,
          so it becomes easier to port over tests from zope.app.testing's
          HTTPCaller.
        
        - X-Powered-By header is now stripped by zope.app.wsgi.testlayer as
          it is by zope.app.testing.
        
        - Bugfix: initialize any <logger> defined in the config, as
          zope.app.server does. (Fixes #291147)
        
        
        3.8.0 (2010-04-14)
        ------------------
        
        - zope.app.wsgi.testlayer is now a lot more compatible with
          the HTTPCaller() functionality in zope.app.testing, which it can
          replace:
        
          - same transaction behavior - pending transactions are committed
            before request and synchronized afterwards.
        
          - support for browser.handleErrors (for zope.testbrowser).
        
          - support for clear-text (non-base64) Basic authentication headers,
            which are easier to read in the tests (though not correct in
            actual HTTP traffic).
        
        
        3.7.0 (2010-04-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Rewrite tests in order not to dependent on ``zope.app.testing`` and
          ``zope.app.zcmlfiles``.
        
        - ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer`` introduces new testing functionality that
          can replace the old functionality in ``zope.app.testing``. In addition,
          it supports using ``zope.testbrowser`` with WSGI directly (instead of
          relying on ``zope.app.testing``, which pulls in a lot of dependencies).
        
          The interesting parts are:
        
          * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.BrowserLayer``: this sets up a minimal layer
            that allows you to use the new WSGI-enabled Browser.
        
          * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.Browser``: this is a subclass of Browser from
            ``zope.testbrowser.browser``. Use it instead of
            ``zope.testbrowser.browser`` directly to use the test browser with WSGI.
            You need to use ``BrowserLayer`` with your tests for this to work.
        
          * ``zope.app.wsgi.testlayer.http``: this is the equivalent to the ``http()``
            function in ``zope.app.testing``. It allows low-level HTTP access
            through WSGI. You need to use ``BrowserLayer`` with your tests for
            this to work.
        
        
        3.6.1 (2010-01-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Support product configuration sections in Zope configuration files.
        
        
        3.6.0 (2009-06-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Import database events directly from ``zope.processlifetime``
          instead of using BBB imports in ``zope.app.appsetup``.
        
        
        3.5.2 (2009-04-03)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` uses now the ``ILoggingInfo`` concept given
          from zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo for log user infos usable for
          access logs. This allows you to implement your own access log user info
          message. See zope.publisher.interfaces.logginginfo.ILoggingInfo for more
          information.
        
        
        3.5.1 (2009-03-31)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` call now provides a user name
          in the environment meant for use in logs.
        
        
        3.5.0 (2009-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Make devmode warning message more generic. We don't nesessary have the
          `etc/zope.conf` file nowadays when using buildout-based setups.
        
        - Add an application factory for Paste. So Zope application can now be
          easily deployed with Paste .ini configuration like this::
        
            [app:main]
            use = egg:zope.app.wsgi
            config_file = %(here)s/zope.conf
            handle_errors = false
        
          The config_file is a required argument, however the handle_errors
          defaults to True if not specified. Setting it to False allows you to
          make WSGIPublisherApplication not handle exceptions itself but
          propagate them to an upper middleware, like WebError or something.
        
        - The ``WSGIPublisherApplication`` constructor and ``getWSGIApplication``
          function now accept optional ``handle_errors`` argument, described
          above.
        
        - Change mailing list address to zope-dev at zope.org instead of retired
          one.
        
        
        3.4.1 (2008-07-30)
        ------------------
        
        - Added Trove classifiers.
        
        - Notify ``WSGIPublisherApplicationCreated`` event when WSGI application is
          created.
        
        - Fixed deprecation warning in ``ftesting.zcml``: ZopeSecurityPolicy moved to
          ``zope.securitypolicy``.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-09-14)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the tests to run on Python 2.5 as well as Python 2.4.
        
        - Split ``getApplication`` into ``config`` and ``getApplication`` so
          that ``config`` could be reused, for example for debugging.
        
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to ``zope.app.wsgi``
        from Zope 3.4.0a1
