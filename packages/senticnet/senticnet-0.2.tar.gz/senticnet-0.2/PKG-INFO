Description: # Senticnet API
        
        Ultra simple API to use Senticnet without be bothered by RDF stuff.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        You need to install the rdflib:
        
        ```
        $ pip install rdflib
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        ```python
        from senticnet.senticnet import Senticnet
        
        sn = Senticnet()
        polarity = sn.polarity('love')
        semantics = sn.semantics('love')
        sentics = sn.sentics('love')
        ```
