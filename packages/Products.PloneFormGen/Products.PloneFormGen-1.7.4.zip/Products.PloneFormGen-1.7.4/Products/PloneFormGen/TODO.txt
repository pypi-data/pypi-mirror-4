Plone 2.5 compatibility leftovers?
    - Do we still need to patch the ZPublisher? See method
      patch_publisher_exception_handling in patches.py
      
      After clearing out the last of the "not HAS_PLONE3" code,
      it looks like it only runs in browser.txt, but is needed
      there to keep the tests working.
