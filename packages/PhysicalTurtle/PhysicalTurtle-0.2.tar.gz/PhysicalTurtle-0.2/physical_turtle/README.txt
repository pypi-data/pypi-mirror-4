Physical Turtle
===============

This is an extension for the Python turtle module that provides a
physical space for a turtle to inhabit. The initial aim is to provide
areas of solid space that the turtle cannot move into.

The Turtle class is extended with the following methods.  This list
may change as the first version of this package is developed.

Generally, methods are used here rather than attributes to be
consistent with the rest of the Turtle interface.

Methods:

* `touch_left()`, `touch_right()`, `touch_front()`, `touch_back()`

  Each one returns True if the Turtle would not be able to move in
  that direction.

* `last_distance()`

  The distance travelled in the preceding forward or backward
  movement. Since the turtle is not able to move through a solid area
  this distance may be less than the distance originally called for.

* `pen_set_solid()`

  Set a pen property so that any movement of the turtle with the pen
  down creates a solid area. The pen colour is not affected, so that
  the lines shown on the screen correspond to lines of solidity in
  the physical space.

  The solid area created by the turtle move is a rectangle
  corresponding to the length of the move and the width of the pen.

  No solid area is drawn in the pen is up.

  The action of filling a polygon with a colour does not create solid
  space.

* `pen_unset_solid()`

  Reverses the action of pen_set_solid so that turtle movement does
  not create solid areas.

The extension provides a new rule that says a turtle cannot cross a
line that has been drawn with `pen_set_solid`. The turtle is allowed
to move up to the soild line and the attribute `last_distance`
gives the distance actually moved.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

- A turtle with pen `up` is allowed to move anywhere. This is allows
  the turtle to move to any place on the screen and is required for
  placing the turtle into an enclosed space.

- A turtle with pen `solid` is allowed to move anywhere. This is
  specifically designed to allow drawing a solid shape where one edge
  must be drawn contiguously with another. (If this was not allowed,
  the second line would not be drawn because it would be trapped by
  the end of the first line.)

Installation
============

Get the version straight from the Python Package Index::

  pip install physical_turtle

Or Get the latest version from Bit Bucket::

    https://bitbucket.org/mikedeplume/physical-turtle

If you do download the repository, don't forget to put the
physical_turtle package on your PYTHON_PATH. The easiest way to do
this is to go into the directory and type::

    python setup.py install

Use
===

The package is intended as a one for one replacement for the builtin
turtle module. Any existing turtle software that you have should work
just as before if you replace::

    from turtle import ...

with::

    from physical_turtle import ...

From that perspective, there is nothing much new to learn.

Example
=======

Random action
+++++++++++++

At the Python prompt:

   >>> from physical_turtle.example_random import run_me
   >>> run_me()

And watch the turtle bounce randomly around an enclosed space. 

Follow an Outline
+++++++++++++++++

At the Python prompt:

   >>> from physical_turtle.example_follow import run_me
   >>> run_me()

And watch the blue line work its way around the solid object.

Change History
==============

Version 0.2
+++++++++++

The `touch_xxx` methods now work. This is illustrated in a new
example, `example_follow.py`.

The internal mechanism for finishing off the line clipping algorithm
has been tidied up.

The internal mechanisms now distinguish properly between the effective
size of the turtle, the safety_radius, as used in line clipping, and
the reach of the `touch_xxx` methods, the stick length.

Version 0.1
+++++++++++

An initial version focussing on the straight line geometry.
