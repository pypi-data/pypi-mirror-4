Introduction
============

unweb.iptc will extract IPTC metadata from uploaded images and will save them
as Dublic Core metadata in Plone. Whenever the Dublin Core metadata is updated
in Plone, the IPTC metadata inside the image file will be respectively
updated.

Works independently, or in combination with unweb.watermark.

No need to install from the Plone Control Panel. Simply add it to your buildout
eggs section.
