Changes
=======

1.0.0 (2013-03-07)
------------------

 * Initial stable release!
 * Chown all files in software root and instance root when doing slapprepare.
   It allows easier USB key replacement.
 * Completely disable root password. Won't create random password.

1.0a7 (2013-01-24)
------------------

 * Fixed a bug where the hostname would contain a newline.

1.0a6 (2013-01-15)
------------------

 * Machine tweaks: raise max AIO NR and nofile, set semaphore limits. This
   allows to run many instances of apache/mysql/zope on the same machine.
 * Mount /var/log on disk in order not to touch USB key.
 * When running slapupdate, will update slapprepare as well.
 * update crontab so that it calls slapupdate randomly. It means: not all
   nodes in the same timezone will try to update at the same time (thus not
   kill cache system).

1.0a5 (2013-01-07)
------------------

 * autoupdate through easy_install before running slapprepare
 * Force start of VPN if defined
 * Add limits.conf file preventing fork bombs and ensuring root can spawn lot
   of processes
