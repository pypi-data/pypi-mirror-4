Description: MegamanicEdit is a tool which enables constructing objects where
        fields are "dynamic", for example in GrailTact, a user can add several
        Email objects, and these are treated as regular fields when editing
        the container (Contact) object.
        
        It also enables adding objects from a template, so for example leads
        interested in something can be greated from a landing page (see
        GrailTact also here).
        
        Has been tested and found working with StringWidget, RichWidget,
        LinesWidget.  Assumed to work with everything except the
        CalendarWidget.
        
        Thanks to Bluedynamics' AtMultiEdit for giving a good example.
        
        Portions of the templates/skins are taken from the Archetypes
        product, which is

        so that it integrates nicely with the megamanic template object class.
