Description: xtree can easily convert an archive or a directory populated by a lot of
        nested subdirectories into a flat tree structure, or the other way round.
        
        This is particularly useful to move files scattered across a lot of
        subdirectories into a single directory, or to move files grouped by a
        common pattern into corresponding subdirectories.
