Description: 
        RedRover
        ========
        
        RedRover is a testing utility suite for Django.  It wraps other powerful
        tools such as Nose and Selinium into an easy to use and read syntax.
        
        The goal of RedRover is not to facilitate Behavior Driven Development --
        a task being very well handled by other projects such as Cucumber -- but
        rather to give Test Driven Development another layer of abstraction
        delivering a more robust TDD environment that is more flexible than BDD.
