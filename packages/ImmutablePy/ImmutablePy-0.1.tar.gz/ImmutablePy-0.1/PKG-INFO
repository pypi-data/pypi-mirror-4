Description: This package provides support for working with immutable data. There is a base class for defining immutable instances. Once initialized, the attributes of such instances are frozen. There are also fully immutable versions of lists/tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Immutability is imposed in a stricter sense than for Python's tuples or frozensets: to qualify as immutable, all of an object's elements and attributes must be immutable as well.
