        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * Django: Might work on older versions but was developed for 1.3.0.
        * IXDjango: Which provides utility functions used here
        * pep8 and pylint: Not required for functionality but we like QC before
        committing any code changes so these tools need to be available. Note that
        if you'd like to contribute, any code you write must give a clean output with
        pep8 and score 10/10 with pylint using the configuration file
        conf/pylint.conf in the package
