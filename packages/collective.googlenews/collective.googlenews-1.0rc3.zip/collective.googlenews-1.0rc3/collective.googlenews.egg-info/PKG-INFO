        Introduction
        ============
        
        `Google News`_ is compiled solely by a computer algorithm that scans all the
        sites included in their system. In order for your content to be included in
        `Google News`_, the layout and format of your site must be easy for their
        crawler to read and decipher. Additionally, they have certain restrictions in
        place to make sure their crawler only includes links to URLs that are actually
        news articles.
        
        Google asks that you to review all of their guidelines before submitting your
        site for inclusion in `Google News`_. Making sure your site conforms to all
        their `technical requirements`_ now will help prevent any issues with your
        site in the future.
        
        This package helps you make your Plone site comply with these `technical
        requirements`_.
        
        Article URLs
        ============
        
        URL need to display a three-digit number. This add-on override the url
        normalizer to add a unique id.
        
        SiteMap
        =======
        
        This add-on add a @@googlenews-sitemap.xml view for topic content type. This
        view add some checks before loading items:
        
        * no more than 1000 items returned
        * items must have been published in the last two days
        * items are ordered on the effective date (reversed)
        
        So you don't need to add criteria for these, but types should be set to News
        Item to be sure you are publishing news.
        
        How to publish my website into Google News ?
        ============================================
        
        You need to have a topic instance in your website. By default in Plone
        /news/aggregator is the one. In the process you can provide the sitemap to
        help google to get the last news by providing the url
        example.com/news/aggregator/@@googlenews-sitemap.xml

        Installation
        ============
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.googlenews`` to the list of
           eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.googlenews
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.0, you may need to extend a plone.app.registry
           known good set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the
           packages that make up plone.app.registry::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                https://good-py.appspot.com/release/plone.app.registry/1.0b2
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.googlenews`` and click the 'Activate'
        button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
