        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery UI Touch Punch`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery UI Touch Punch`: http://touchpunch.furf.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jqueryui_touch_punch``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``touch_punch`` from ``js.jqueryui_touch_punch`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jqueryui_touch_punch import touch_punch
          >>> touch_punch.need()
