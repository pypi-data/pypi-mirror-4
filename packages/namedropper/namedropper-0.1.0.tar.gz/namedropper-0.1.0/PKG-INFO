Description: name-dropper scripts
        ====================
        
        Python scripts and utilities for looking up names and linking them to
        authoritative identifiers.
        
        Currently uses `DBpedia Spotlight`_ for recognition of named entities in text,
        with support for matching identified DBpedia resources (currently only for
        Persons) with the equivalent resource in `VIAF`_ (Virtual International
        Authority File).
