# Data Packager (data_packager) #

Provides simple tools to allow for the versioned packaging of arbitrary
assets.

For instance, suppose you have a given data set that your apps depend upon,
which change slowly, but have considerable impact on your appllication
behaviors.

You want to manage the data set on a versioned basis, such that somebody
can install a specific version of the data into their virtualenv.

This gives a simple way for organizing such packages and a simple interface
for accessing assets within them.
