The most basic possible cms for a django app

add bland.views.root('/path/to/your/txt/files') as a view

.txt files will be rendered using markdown in such a way that
these URLs will work based on this file structure

/ -> index.txt
/about -> about.html
/sub/ -> sub/index.txt
/sub/info -> sub/info.txt
