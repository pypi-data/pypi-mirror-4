Description: mr.poe
        ======
        
        mr.poe is a fork of Raven for Python 2.4 compatibility. Not all of the
        contrib modules are fully convered, but the Zope one has been modified to give
        useful messages for the Zope 2.10 era.
        
        **Note**: This is just an updated distribution name, you cannot have both Raven and mr.poe installed in the same environment, so *please*, sandbox your apps.
        
        Raven
        =====
        
        Raven is a Python client for `Sentry <http://www.getsentry.com/>`_. It provides
        full out-of-the-box support for many of the popular frameworks, including
        Django, and Flask. Raven also includes drop-in support for any WSGI-compatible
        web application.
        
        Your application doesn't live on the web? No problem! Raven is easy to use in
        any Python application.
