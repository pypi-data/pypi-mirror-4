Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product was created to help you remove nasty local persistent
        utilities that won't go away and can destroy your instance when
        you try to remove a product that registered one.
        
        Features
        --------
        
         - remove adapters
         - remove subscribers
         - remove provided interfaces
         - remove provided interfaces across the entire site
           - useful for removing collective.flowplayer
        
        Just append '/@@fix-persistent-utilities' onto your plone site root
        or the root of zope(for gsm) and browse through all your registered
        utilities on your site and remove things at will.
        
        By default, the tools prevents you from removing certain 
        registrations; however, you can enter "expert mode" and remove 
        whatever you want.
        
        
        
        
        WARNING!!!
        ----------
        
        You can really screw up things if you do this wrong so use with
        extreme care and backup your instance before you use it.
        
        I will not take responsibility if you misuse this tool...
        
        
        Advice
        ------
        
        Do not include this product as part of your normal set of
        products. Only install this product on debug zope clients.
        
        This product should allow you to remove things from products that are
        no longer installed on the system; although, if you experience problems
        removing things, make sure to add those eggs to the system again.
        
        
        Automatically generate missing classes
        --------------------------------------
        
        If you no longer have a product installed that you're trying to
        remove, FPU can dynamically create the fake class for you.
        
        *this is dangerous if you don't delete fake class*
        
        To enable, specify this environment variable::
        
            FPU_GENERATE_MISSING_CLASSES true
