        Object-Oriented file and path handling.

        The std lib file and path options aren't very pythonic. 
        I should be able to perform basic tasks directly on the file.

        Retrieve other file information:
        --------------------------------
        >>> oofile.sha1
        'e90296612f91b8adf498884b20c8356113c83a73'
        >>> oofile.modified_time
        datetime.datetime(2013, 1, 14, 9, 10, 31)
