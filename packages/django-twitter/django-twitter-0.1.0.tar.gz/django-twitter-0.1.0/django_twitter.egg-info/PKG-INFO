Description: django-twitter allows your users to login into your application using Twitter in a easy way.
        
        How To Use
        ==========
        1. Add 'twitter' to your apps list
        
        2. Include('twitter.urls') in your url app
        
        3. Add in settings.py:
            CONSUMER_KEY = "your_consumer_key"
            CONSUMER_SECRET = "your_consumer_secret"
            CALLBACK_URL = 'your_awesome_url'
        
        CONSUMER_KEY: You can obtain it from your Twitter account.
        CONSUMER_SECRET: You can obtain it from your Twitter account.
        CALLBACK_URL: is the url inside your application that should be shown when the authentication process went ok. It must be same as Twitter callback url.
        
        4. Connect with tokens_received signal:
        
        from twitter import signals
        
        def tokens_received(sender, request, screen_name, oauth_token, oauth_token_secret, **kwargs):
            #Your stuff here
        
        signals.tokens_received.connect(tokens_received)
        
        How it works
        ============
        To insert the link to Twitter, include this in your template : {% url twitter_begin_auth %} in a link.
        When the user click on the link, is redirected to Twitter, and once logged in, it will redirect you to CALLBACK_URL in your application and tokens_received signal will be raised.
        
        NOTE:
        -----
        Remember that your Twitter callback url must be the same as CALLBACK_URL
        
        Dependencies
        ============
