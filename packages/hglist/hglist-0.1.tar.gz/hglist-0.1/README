hglist extension for Mercurial
------------------------------

This extension adds an `hg list`/`hg ls` command to Mercurial, which works
a bit like UNIX `ls` (though the switches, sadly, are a bit different---but
that's unavoidable because Mercurial reserves some of the names we'd need
to use to be compatible).

See the help documentation within Mercurial for more details.
