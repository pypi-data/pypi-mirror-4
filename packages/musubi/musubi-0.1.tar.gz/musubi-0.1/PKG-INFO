        Setup
        -----
        
        First, you need to create a virtual environment and activate it.
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install virtualenv
          $ virtualenv musubi
          $ . musubi/bin/activate
          (musubi)$ 
        
        Next, install ``musubi`` in the environment.
        
        ::
        
          (musubi)$ pip install musubi
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        With musubi setup, you can now play with it.
        
        To see a list of commands availble, run::
        
          (musubi)$ musubi --help
        
        Here are some of the commands you can try:
        
        ::
        
          (musubi)$ musubi mx cakebread.info
          (musubi)$ musubi ips cakebread.info
          (musubi)$ musubi spf dreamhost.com
          (musubi)$ musubi scan toad.com
        
        
        ::
        
        
        
        To see help for an individual command, include the command name on the
        command line::
        
          (musubi)$ musubi scan --help
        
        Important
        ---------
        
        If you pass an IP range in CIDR notation, please understand what you're 
        doing. Each IP in that range will be tested against 70+ DNSBLs which
        could potentially make thousands of DNS/UDP connections very quickly.
        Do not try this at home! If you are an ISP or web hosting company,
        it should not be a problem.
        
        Cleaning Up
        -----------
        
        Finally, when done, deactivate your virtual environment::
        
          (musubi)$ deactivate
          $
