Pynuts: Documents for nuts
==========================

Pynuts is a Flask extension simplifying the implementation of the generic views of your app.

It allows you to:

* implement and configure CRUD view functions in a few lines, using your database schema.
secure your application by easily managing user permissions using the request context.
* generate HTML, ReST and PDF documents containing data from any model instance you created.
* manage different versions of these document with an embedded git repository.
* drastically reduce the amount of code to write and development time by focusing on your application logic and deferring the boring parts to Pynuts.
