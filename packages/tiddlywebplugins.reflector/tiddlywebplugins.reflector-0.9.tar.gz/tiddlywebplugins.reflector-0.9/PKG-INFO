Description: 
        First stab at tiddlywebplugins.reflector, a reflector
        plugin idea from Ben Gillies:
        
        * Post a file to the reflector and it gets returned to the
          browser with the content-type it was given.
        * If you put the sending form in an iframe, then you can
          gather up the content of the iframe and give it to 
          tiddlywiki for use in the import routines.
