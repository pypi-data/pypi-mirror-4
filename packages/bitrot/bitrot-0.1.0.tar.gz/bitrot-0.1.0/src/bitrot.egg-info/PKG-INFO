Description: ======
        bitrot
        ======
        
        Detects bit rotten files on the hard drive to save your precious photo and
        music collection from slow decay.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Go to the desired directory and simply invoke::
        
          $ bitrot
        
        This will start digging through your directory structure recursively indexing
        all files found. The index is stored in a ``.bitrot.db`` file which is a SQLite
        3 database.
        
        Next time you run ``bitrot`` it will add new files and update the index for
        files with a changed modification date. Most importantly however, it will
        report all errors, e.g. files that changed on the hard drive but still have the
        same modification date.
        
        Performance
        -----------
        
        Obviously depends on how fast the underlying drive is. No rigorous performance
        tests have been done. For informational purposes, on my typical 5400 RPM laptop
        hard drive scanning a 60+ GB music library takes around 20 minutes. On an OCZ
        Vertex 3 SSD drive ``bitrot`` is able to scan a 100 GB Aperture library in
        under 10 minutes. Both tests on HFS+.
