<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>The <em>Validation Dashboard</em> is your window to
test results, regardless of how your run your tests you
can upload the results here and analyze them with simple
built-in views. Additionally, you can export data view
the <a href="{% url lava.api_help %}">XML-RPC API</a>
to build your own customized reports.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The dashboard stores results of tests in <em>bundles</em>. These
bundles are then grouped by a thing called <em>bundle streams</em>.
You can drill down by viewing the
<a href="{% url dashboard_app.views.bundle_stream_list %}">bundle stream list</a>.
However, that view can present too much data.</p>

<p>There are two good ways to limit the data in order to see the
results you are interested in</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p><a href="{% url dashboard_app.views.filters.views.filters_list %}">Filters</a>
allow you to create your own list of criteria for what you'd like to look at.
These can be created as "public" so others can use them, or private so only
you can see them.</p>

<h3>Image Reports</h3>
<p><a href="{% url dashboard_app.views.images.image_report_list %}">Image Reports</a>
are a feature built on top of filters, that allow a nice view of daily jobs
that are being run in LAVA.</p>
