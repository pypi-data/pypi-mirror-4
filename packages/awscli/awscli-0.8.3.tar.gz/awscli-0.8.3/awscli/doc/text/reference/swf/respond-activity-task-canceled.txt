respond-activity-task-canceled
******************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Used by workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified
by the "--task-token" was successfully canceled. Additional "--
details" can be optionally provided using the "--details" argument.

These "--details" (if provided) appear in the "ActivityTaskCanceled"
event added to the workflow history.

Warning: Only use this operation if the "canceled" flag of a record-activity-
  task-heartbeat request returns "true" and if the activity can be
  safely undone or abandoned.

A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it
is closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is
processing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a call
to  respond-activity-task-completed , RespondActivityTaskCanceled,
respond-activity-task-failed , or the task has timed out .

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the domain name to limit the action to
  only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For --details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf respond-activity-task-canceled
     --task-token <value>
     [--details <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--task-token"  (string)
   The "--task-token" of the  ActivityTask .

   Warning: The "--task-token" is generated by the service and should be
     treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another
     process, its "--task-token" must also be passed. This enables it
     to provide its progress and respond with results.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--details"  (string)
   Optional information about the cancellation.
