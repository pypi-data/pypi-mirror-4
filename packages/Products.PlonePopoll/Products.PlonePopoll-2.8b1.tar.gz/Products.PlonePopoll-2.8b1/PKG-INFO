        About PlonePopoll
        #################
        
        This is a Poll tool for Plone.
        
        Requirements
        ############
        
        * Plone 3.0
        
        Instalation
        ###########
        
        Add Products.PlonePopoll in your buildout.cfg eggs list.
        
        Use the portal_quickinstaller of your Plone site.
        
        Contributors and others can add polls.
        
        Managers can add and configure PoPoll portlets using the new Plone 3
        portlets managers.
        
        Users of older PlonePopoll versions will notice that the (now useless)
        configuration panel has disappeared.

        Architecture
        ############
        
        A poll can be in one and only one of those states:
        
        * enabled
        * disabled
        
        Results can be in one and only one of those states:
        
        * visible
        * not visible
        
        Poll can have multiple choice activated, determining how many choice a
        user can do.
        
        
        Note
        ####
        
        Within Plone, it's possible to vote for a poll only if it is enabled
        AND published.
        
        Results are displayed only when the *Results Visibility* is set to
        visible.
        
        
        Migration
        #########
        
        If you migrate from an oooooold PlonePopoll version (1.x) that's not
        Archetypes based, create an external method in your Plone site:
        
        * Id: migrate_popoll
        * Title: (whatever)
        * Module: PlonePopoll.Migration
        * Function: migrateToArchetypes
        
        Then click the "Test" tab of this external method.

        CHANGES

        Considered future features
        ##########################
        
        New types of polls may be interesting (Idea from
        http://www.apwiz.com/flexivote.htm):
        
        * open poll lets you see results before voting
        * in a blind vote you must vote first, but can see all details
        * In private poll you see results but not how people voted
        * In a secret vote only the owner can see results and voting pattern.
        
        To do
        #####
        
        * Test SQL back-end (find volunteers, we don't want to support this in
          the future).
        
        * Cleanup and spread in appropriate external methods what's in
          Extensions/Install.py. We install with GenericSetup from now.
        
        * Provide zconfig features to select and configure the votes back-end
          (see note about SQL back-end above)
        
        * Use a Zope 3 view for the poll to speed up
        
        * Should we keep migrations ? (useless for old AT based Popoll).
        
        * Notify translators about new msgids.
        
        * Why are the entries of the combo in portlet configuration untranslated when the code (browser/popoll.py)
