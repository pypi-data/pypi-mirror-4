        =====
        
        The ``pkgme`` program is a framework for generating Debian packaging artifacts
        from information gleaned from inspecting the code.  The framework takes care
        of the common tasks, and knows about packaging in general.  It is extensible
        so that programming language-specific conventions and rules can be supported.
        
        
        Project information
        ===================
        
        ``pkgme`` development is `hosted on Launchpad`_.  Please see the project page
        for downloads, bug reports, and accessing the latest code (available in the
        Bazaar_ version control system).  You can also subscribe to the `pkgme mailing
        list`_ for discussions on using and extending ``pkgme``.  The archives_ are
        also available on-line.

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        In addition to the various Python modules documented in ``setup.py``,
        ``pkgme`` depends on ``devscripts`` and ``debhelper``.
        
        
        Developers
        ==========
        
        To get a development environment set up (using ``buildout``) run::
        
           $ make bootstrap
        
        You can then run the tests with
        
           $ make check
        
        The bootstrap will fail if you have a system-wide install of buildout that
        is the same version as the one in use by this project. (You will see
        ``DistributionNotFound: zc.buildout==<version>``). If you encounter
        that then you can either remove the site-wide install, or use a virtualenv
        to run the bootstrap step.
        
        You can get a shell to try code interactively by running ``./bin/py``.
        
        Buildout uses two directories as caches that can be shared between branches.
        The first is the ``download-cache`` directory. This contains all of the
        distributions of the Python dependencies. You can get this from
        ``lp:ca-download-cache``, but the Makefile will grab it for you.
        
        The other directory is the ``eggs`` directory that holds built versions
        of the dependencies.
        
        The default for both of these is to symlink them from the parent directory,
        but if you wish to put them somewhere else you can set the locations with
        the ``CA_DOWNLOAD_CACHE_DIR`` and ``CA_EGGS_DIR`` environment variables.
        
        
        If you want to override the default location of the backends, set the
        environment variable ``$PKGME_BACKEND_PATHS``.  This is a colon-separated list
        of directories, for example:
        
            % export PKGME_BACKEND_PATHS=/pkgme/foo-backends:/pkgme/bar-backends
            % cd my-about-to-be-packaged-code
            % ~/path/to/branch/bin/pkgme
        
        
        Building the documentation
        --------------------------
        
        If you have the Sphinx toolchain installed (on Debian/Ubuntu, the
        python-sphinx package), you can build the documentation like so::
        
            % make html
        
        You'll need to be in your virtualenv, and you should have installed ``pkgme``
        in that virtualenv before trying to build the documentation.

        NEWS for pkgme
        ==============
        
        0.4.3 (2012-09-27)
        ==================
        
        Improvements
        ------------
        
          * all_info is only called once, rather than three times. The three calls were
            the same, so all it was doing was wasting time.  (Jonathan Lange)
        
          * Be more careful in how the .orig.tar.gz is constructed when building a source
            package. Some overly general transformations were being applied, that changed
            the content of some packages, and so caused the package to fail to build.
            (James Westby)
        
        
        0.4.2 (2012-09-25)
        ==================
        
        Improvements
        ------------
        
         * Distribution defaults to "UNRELEASED" if there is no ``/etc/lsb-release``
           file, rather than erroring out.  (Natalia)
        
         * More logging on how long various steps take.  (Jonathan Lange)
        
        
        0.4.1 (2012-09-12)
        ==================
        
        Changes
        -------
        
         * ``query_backends`` raises a ``NoEligibleBackend`` error if there are no
           eligible backends.  (Jonathan Lange).
        
        Improvements
        ------------
        
         * Backends can now specify extra fields to be added to the binary package
           stanza in debian/control.  (James Westby)
        
        
        0.4.0 (2012-09-06)
        ==================
        
        Changes
        -------
        
         * ``BackendSelector.get_eligible_backends`` returns a list of dicts, rather
           than a list of ``(score, backend)`` 2-tuples.  (Jonathan Lange)
        
         * New module ``pkgme.api`` that has the useful stuff from the pkgme script.
           (Jonathan Lange)
        
         * ``pkgme.bin.main.get_all_info`` has been removed.  Use
           ``packaging_info_as_data(get_all_info(...))`` instead.  Both are in
           ``pkgme.api``.  (Jonathan Lange)
        
        
        Deprecations
        ------------
        
         * ``pkgme.write_packaging``.  Instead use ``pkgme.api.get_all_info`` to get
           packaging information, and ``pkgme.api.write_packaging_info`` to write it
           out to disk.  (Jonathan Lange)
        
         * From ``pkgme.testing``, ``TempdirFixture``, ``FileFixture`` and
           ``ExecutableFileFixture``.  Use ``treeshape.FileTree`` instead.
        
        
        0.3.1 (2012-08-28)
        ==================
        
        Improvements
        ------------
        
         * Backends can now signal that their errors are intended for end-user
           consumption by exiting with return code, ``ScriptUserError.RETURN_CODE``.
        
        Changes
        -------
        
         * Many matchers were removed from ``pkgme.testing``.  These matchers are now
           available in `testtools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools>`_ 0.9.13 or
           later.
        
         * Switched to buildout for handling dependencies.
        
        
        0.3 (2012-08-03)
        ================
        
         * New release, lots of new features.
        
        0.2 (201X-XX-XX)
        ================
        
        0.1 (201X-XX-XX)
        ================
         * Initial release.
