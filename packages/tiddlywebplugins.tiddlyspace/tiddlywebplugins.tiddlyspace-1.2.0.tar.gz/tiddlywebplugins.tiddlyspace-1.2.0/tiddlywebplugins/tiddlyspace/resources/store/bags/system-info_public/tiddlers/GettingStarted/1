Welcome to your brand new [[TiddlySpace]]@glossary.

You're almost ready to go, there are just a couple of things left to do.

!Customise your space
Go to [[SpaceSettings]] to finish customising  your space. When you're done, come back here (just scroll up). Don't worry though, this will still be open when you've finished.

!Finished customising?
You can [[Start writing]] some [[tiddlers|Tiddler]]@glossary.
If you're not done tweaking yet though, you can always [[Customise this space|SpaceSettings]] a bit more.

!Administration
If you'd like to change your password or create another space, visit "Your Account" from the UniversalBackstage@faq (the blue dot in the upper right of the page). If you'd like to add a member or [[include a space|How do I include/exclude spaces?]]@faq visit "This Space" from the UniversalBackstage@faq.

You can have as many spaces as you like and each space can have as many members as you or your group need.

!Stuck?
If you're stuck, and would like some help, please visit the [[help|http://help.tiddlyspace.com]] space, which can point you in the right direction.
