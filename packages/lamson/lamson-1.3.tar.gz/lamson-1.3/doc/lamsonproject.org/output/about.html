                <h1>About Lamson</h1>
                	<p>Lamson started more than a year ago as a fun side project of <a href="http://zedshaw.com/">mine</a> 
after a few evil experiences with sendmail and various mailing list software.  I 
realized that e-mail systems didn&#8217;t have anything like a modern &#8220;framework&#8221; for building 
applications.  Rather than replicate the mess of aliases, pipes, processes, and nasty m4 
macros that currently existed, I decided to write something different.</p>

	<p>Lamson was originally called &#8220;Son Of Sam&#8221;, but that name proved too difficult to work
with as a project name.  Apparently people don&#8217;t like their software named after serial
killers (actually, that was his dog&#8217;s name).</p>

	<p>&#8220;Lamson Tubes&#8221; is a colloquial name for Pneumatic Tubes which were used last century to 
deliver mail, packages, and hazardous material to the corporate world.  They are still
in use today.</p>

	<p>Now Lamson is a fully functioning <span class="caps">SMTP</span> server, relay, proxy, and e-mail application framework.
It supports most <span class="caps">RDBMS</span>, has templates, and is easy to manage and deploy.  Lamson is smarter
than most any e-mail processing system out there thanks to Python.</p>

	<p>However, as great as Lamson is for processing email intelligently, it isn&#8217;t the best solution
for delivering mail.  There is 30+ years of <span class="caps">SMTP</span> lore and myth stored in the code of mail
servers such as <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> and <a href="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a> that would
take years to replicate and make efficient.  Being a practical project, Lamson defers to much
more capable <span class="caps">SMTP</span> servers for the grunt work of getting the mail to the final recipient.</p>

	<p>I currently use Lamson in my own work, but I&#8217;m always looking for people doing 
interesting things with e-mail.  Even if you&#8217;re a spammer, or someone trying to
destroy the spammers, I want to hear from you.</p>

	<p>If you&#8217;ve got something interesting, feel free to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> and
talk about it.</p>
