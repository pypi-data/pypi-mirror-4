                <h1>Lamson 1.0pre2, HTML Email, Standalone</h1>
                	<p>Lamson 1.0pre2 features two features that might signal the end of the beginning or
the beginning of the end, depending on your perspective: <span class="caps">HTML</span> Email and Lamson Standalone.
<span class="caps">HTML</span> Email support comes from a new module 
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.html-module.html">lamson.html</a> that gives a nice template
method to send out <span class="caps">HTML</span> to victims&#8230;uh&#8230;customers.  Lamson Standalone will be a way
to run Lamson as your customized email server instead of another server like Postfix.</p>

	<p>Both of these features will be done for Lamson 1.0, but are currently just getting started
as of 1.0pre2.  Once they&#8217;re done that will be the last two requested features people
had before 1.0.</p>

	<h2>Getting This Release</h2>

	<p>As usual, you can get this <a href="/releases/">release from /releases</a> or if you are too lazy to
read that page then do this:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
$ sudo easy_install -U lamson
</pre>

	<p>In addition, if you want play with the new features you&#8217;ll need to install these (optional)
Python libraries:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
$ sudo easy_install -U pydns
$ sudo easy_install -U beautifulsoup
$ sudo easy_install -U markdown2
$ sudo easy_install -U clevercss
</pre>

	<p>I&#8217;ll decide if I should make these mandatory or optional with the next release based on
people&#8217;s feedback.</p>

	<h2>Lamson Standalone</h2>

	<p>Quite a few people have asked for a way to install Lamson as their primary email server.
Usually they want it for just their own email on a machine just for them where installing
something like Postfix is overkill or just too hard.  This is entirely possible
with Lamson, but it&#8217;s kind of not the right use for it since simple delivery of mail is
much better handled and implemented by an older server like Postfix.</p>

	<p>Rather than resist giving people a way to setup Lamson as their primary mail server, I&#8217;ve
decided to start making it possible for them.  By the next release (1.0pre3) you&#8217;ll be able
to run Lamson as your only email server for small installations handling mail for one person.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll also include a <a href="/videos/">screen cast</a> showing people how to use the standalone functionality
to build a <strong>Personal Mail Management Server</strong> to filter and control their mail without any
other mail server.  I&#8217;m going to treat this as a first project for most people wanting to get
started using Lamson for their email.</p>

	<p>As of 1.0pre2, the functionality that&#8217;s available is code in the <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.server.Relay-class.html">lamson.server.Relay</a> 
that will use <a href="http://pydns.sourceforge.net/">PyDNS</a> to query up the MX host for 
recipient addresses.  It&#8217;s fairly primitive right now, but you use it by creating
a Relay with the host explicitly None:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
relay = server.Relay(host=None, port=25, debug=1)
</pre>

	<p>Once you do this the Relay will lookup the hosts rather than trying to send through a relay 
host.</p>

	<p>Don&#8217;t go crazy with this yet, since it has to be tested with various kind of nasty email
addressing out there, and it needs to have a way to generate a bounce when it has an error.</p>

	<h2><span class="caps">HTML</span> Email</h2>

	<p>Well, I broke down and implemented my idea for making <span class="caps">HTML</span> Email easy as hell to generate.
In the past I didn&#8217;t want to include simple <span class="caps">HTML</span> support because, well, <span class="caps">HTML</span> Email is
annoying as hell and I didn&#8217;t want to deal with the support headaches.  I knew once I threw
<span class="caps">HTML</span> generation into Lamson I&#8217;d have an army of marketing people using Lamson poorly to
generate their marketing materials.  I also think that <span class="caps">HTML</span> formatting in email doesn&#8217;t work
as a customer development strategy.</p>

	<p>Yet, every time I tell someone about Lamson, the very first, second, third, and 300th thing they
ask is if it does <span class="caps">HTML</span> Email.  Over and over and over this was the most important feature, above
spam blocking, filtering, building applications, intelligent state management, or anything else
that Lamson supports.</p>

	<p>Well, if the people want <span class="caps">HTML</span> email generation, then the people will get it.  I introduce
you to <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.html-module.html">lamson.html</a> which
makes it trivial to produce <span class="caps">HTML</span> in your email and doing it in a nice clean way using
<a href="http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss/">CleverCSS</a> and <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/">Jinja2</a>
templates.</p>

	<p>Let&#8217;s start with the simplest little example that will send out a disgusting html template:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
import sys
from lamson import html, server
from config import testing

relay = server.Relay(host=None, port=25, debug=1)
hs = html.HtmlMail("style.css", "html_test.html")

title = "Test Message HTML"

msg = hs.respond(locals(), "content.markdown", From=sys.argv[1], 
                 To=sys.argv[2], Subject="Test %(title)s")

relay.deliver(msg)
</pre>

	<p>You could run this right out of the Lamson source tree like this:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
export PYTHONPATH=tests
python sender.py thedude@thedude.com victim@gmail.com
</pre>

	<p>The result would look like this in victim&#8217;s email:</p>

	<p><img src="html_email_in_gmail.png" alt="" /></p>

	<h2>How lamson.html.HtmlMail Works</h2>

	<p>The rationale behind the HtmlMail class is that you&#8217;ll typically have a template you
want to send, some <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and then body content that you&#8217;ll plug into the template
as a slug for each person.  What HtmlMail does is let you setup the template as <span class="caps">HTML</span>
with Jinja2, and then specify your <span class="caps">CSS</span> using CleverCSS (which is way easier).</p>

	<p>When you go to send, you generate a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
template as the body.  This lets you write the actual body of your <span class="caps">HTML</span> mail the same
way you would a regular email, but still let&#8217;s you get a good <span class="caps">HTML</span> output using the
HTML/<span class="caps">CSS</span> templates.  With markdown regular folks can write the marketing copy for
your spam while keeping the design separated.</p>

	<p>HtmlMail then glues this all together by doing the following:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Parses your CleverCSS template (after running it through Jinja2).</li>
		<li>Runs your content markdown through Jinja2 and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/">markdown2</a> just like all your other Lamson templates.</li>
		<li>Injects your <span class="caps">CSS</span> <strong>into</strong> your <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags so that you get your styles even though many clients rip out the <strong>style</strong> tags from your <span class="caps">HTML</span>.  See the output sample below.</li>
		<li>Knits your generated content into your <span class="caps">HTML</span> template as the {{content}} variable.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The end result is that these two lines of code from the above sample:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
...
hs = html.HtmlMail("style.css", "html_test.html")

...
msg = hs.respond(locals(), "content.markdown", From=sys.argv[1], 
                 To=sys.argv[2], Subject="Test %(title)s")
</pre>

	<p>Will let you blast out well formatted <span class="caps">HTML</span> emails that have a high probability
of displaying in most mail clients.</p>

	<h2>How The <span class="caps">HTML</span> And <span class="caps">CSS</span> Looks</h2>

	<p>Here&#8217;s what each of the files in the above sample look like.  First the <code>style.css</code>:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
body:
    margin: 10
    padding: 20
    background: green - 30
    color: blue

    h1:
        font-size: 3em
    h2:
        font-size: 2em
        color: yellow

    h2:
        font-size: 1em

    p:
        padding: 0.3em
        background: red

h2:
    color: yellow

#bright:
    background: black
    color: white

.dull:
    background: gray
    color: black
</pre>

	<p>Notice that <a href="http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss/">CleverCSS</a> supports quite a few
very cool features, like calling functions, nesting, variables, and calculations.</p>

	<p>Next you have the outer template <code>html_template.html</code> that wraps your content markdown template.  Notice
that there&#8217;s no <strong>style</strong> tag where the above CleverCSS is placed.  That gets done 
later by lamson.html.HtmlMail.</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body style="background: magenta"&gt;
        &lt;h1 class="bright"&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

        {{ content }}

        &lt;h2 id="dull"&gt;All done.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Finally, you have the <code>content.markdown</code> file that has your basic markdown formatted email:</p>

<pre class="code">
Hello
=====

I would *love* for you to tell me what is going on here joe.  NOW!

Alright
-------

This is the best I can come up with.

Zed
</pre>

	<p>You can use any format you want by changing a setting when you construct your HtmlMail object,
but markdown seems to be the closest to what people would send as plain text for their email.
In fact, I&#8217;d like to find a way to send the raw markdown as the plaintext version of each <span class="caps">HTML</span>
email that goes out.</p>

	<p>With the above three components, you then get the following output:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Test Message HTML&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body style="margin: 10; padding: 20; background: #006200; color: blue"&gt;
&lt;h1 class="bright" style="background: black; color: white"&gt;Test Message HTML&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 style="font-size: 3em"&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="padding: 0.3em; background: red"&gt;I would &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; for you to tell me what is going on here joe.  NOW!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 style="color: yellow"&gt;Alright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p style="padding: 0.3em; background: red"&gt;This is the best I can come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding: 0.3em; background: red"&gt;Zed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dull" style="background: gray; color: black"&gt;All done.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Like magic HtmlMail has taken your CleverCSS file and merged it into the tags of your <span class="caps">HTML</span> to
style it, making it work in most clients without forcing you to do it manually.  It does this by
walking the <span class="caps">CSS</span> and generated <span class="caps">HTML</span> with <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>
and setting the <strong>style</strong> attribute as it goes.</p>

	<h2>Librelist <span class="caps">JSON</span> Archives</h2>

	<p>There&#8217;s been a ton of work on <a href="http://librelist.com/">librelist.com</a> to make it
work better, but the big feature is a complete <span class="caps">JSON</span> dump of the mail archives
and a new <a href="http://librelist.com/browser/">Archive Browser</a> for reading the
archives.</p>

	<p>The browser is just a fast one day hack I did to prove that the <span class="caps">JSON</span>
archive format was good.  It uses <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a> to build
the interface, and has <strong>no servers side software other than Nginx.</strong>  Yes, you
read that right, there is no Django behind this, just a pure <a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a>
setup serving files and directory indexes.</p>

	<p>The real meat of this setup is the Lamson server on librelist and an Nginx module.  </p>

	<p>First, the librelist server generates a <span class="caps">JSON</span> version of each archived email which
you <a href="http://librelist.com/archives/lamson/2009/07/30/json/1248947932.M724307P15430Q6.09c5769d5b9f3d575cefc2ccb51877ec.json">can see here</a> with your browser.  This <span class="caps">JSON</span> actually loads as an 
object in JavaScript, so you have code like this:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
function appendMessage(msg) {
    display = '&lt;div id="message"&gt;&lt;div id="header"&gt;' +
        '&lt;div&gt;' + msg.headers['Date'] + '&lt;/div&gt;' +
        '&lt;div id="addressing"&gt;' + msg.headers['From'] + '&lt;/div&gt;' +
        '&lt;div id="subject"&gt;' + msg.headers['Subject'] + '&lt;/div&gt;' +
        '&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="body"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;' +
        summarize(msg) +
        '&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'

        $("#messages").append(display);
}
</pre>

	<p>Second, there&#8217;s a tiny modification to Nginx&#8217;s
<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpAutoindexModule">autoindex</a> I made so that
it will generate a <a href="http://librelist.com/archives/lamson/2009/07/"><span class="caps">JSON</span> version of the index instead of HTML</a>
so that you can &#8220;browse&#8221; the stored <span class="caps">JSON</span> files via JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
function loadDay(date) {
    if(window.MAILING_LIST) {
        $.getJSON("/archives/" + window.MAILING_LIST + date + "/json/", {},
        function(data) {
            $("#messages").empty();
            base = data[0]
            msgs = data[1]
            for(i in msgs) {
                fetchMessage(base + msgs[i])
            }
        });
    } else {
        $("#messages").html("&lt;h2&gt;Now pick a list to look at for that day.&lt;/h2&gt;");
    }
}
</pre>

	<p>With those two components I can export a <span class="caps">JSON</span> version of the mailing list archives without
having to run a large web framework.</p>
