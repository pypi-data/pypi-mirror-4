Description: Return a list of strings as a compact set of columns arranged 
        horizontally or vertically.
        
        For example, for a line width of 4 characters (arranged vertically):
            ['1', '2,', '3', '4'] => '1  3\n2  4\n'
           
        or arranged horizontally:
            ['1', '2,', '3', '4'] => '1  2\n3  4\n'
                
        Each column is only as wide as necessary.  By default, columns are
        separated by two spaces - one was not legible enough. Set "colsep"
        to adjust the string separate columns. Set `displaywidth' to set
        the line width. 
        
        Normally, consecutive items go down from the top to bottom from
        the left-most column to the right-most. If +arrange_vertical+ is
        set false, consecutive items will go across, left to right, top to
        bottom.

        0.3.5
        
        - Reinstate ability to run on older Pythons. In particular Python
          2.4.6 and 2.5.6 now. I suppose other version in between work too.
        
        - Add opts hash to bundle the growing options old and new:
          * arrange_array
          * arrange_vertical
          * arrange_horizontal
          * array_prefix
          * array_suffix
          * colsep
          * colfmt
          * displaywidth
          * lineprefix
          * linesuffix
          * ljust
        
        - Fixes to make source tarball work. (Added test files properly)
        
        0.3.4 01-03-13
        - Make 3k tolerant. This means it no longer works for versions less
          than Python 2.6.
        
        0.3.3 10-28-10 -

        0.3.2 03-08-09 - Ron Frankel -1 Release
        
        - Relax restriction that array has to be string. Now is just something
          we can call str() on each of the elements on.
        
        - Correct bug in vertical alignment
        
        - Add an optional initial line prefix string
