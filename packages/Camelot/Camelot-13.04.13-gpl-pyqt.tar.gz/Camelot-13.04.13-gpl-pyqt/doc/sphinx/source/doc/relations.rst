Relations
=========

SQLAlchemy uses the `relationship` function to define relations between classes.
This function can be used within Camelot as well.

On top of this, Camelot provides some construct in the :mod:`camelot.core.orm.relationships` that make setting up relationships a bit easier.

.. automodule:: camelot.core.orm.relationships
