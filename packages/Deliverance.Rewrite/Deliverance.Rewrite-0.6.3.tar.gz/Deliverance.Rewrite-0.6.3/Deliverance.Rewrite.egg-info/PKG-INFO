Description: 
        Deliverance does transformations of HTML to 'theme' pages, 
        similar in function to XSLT but using a simpler 
        XML-based language to express the transformation.

        -------------------
        
        * Deliverance now discards caching headers from the request before fetching 
          the theme resource, since it doesn't know how to handle 304 responses internally.
          This prevents Deliverance from serving unthemed content if the client request
          contains caching headers that would cause the theme server to respond with
          304 Not Modified.
