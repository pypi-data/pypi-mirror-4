----------------------------
- Fixed bug that prevented Image Analysis Window from updating even if the user
  had changed the order of images in the main input image window
- Reset image index to zero every time Image Analysis Window is opened so first
  image is always shown
- Added QFrame with label to Image Analysis Window to identify the index of the 
  current image displayed
- Provided new sample medical images (output from pyvXRAY - soon to be released 
  on PyPi), both with and without implant
