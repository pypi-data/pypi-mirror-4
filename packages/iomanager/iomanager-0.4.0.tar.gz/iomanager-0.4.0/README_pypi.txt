``iomanager`` is a tool for guaranteeing the structure and composition of
input and output from a Python program, with web applications in mind.

If you are using Python 2.7.4 or lower, you should use ``iomanager``
version 0.3.5. If you are using Python 3.x, you should use the most current
version of ``iomanager``. Python 2.x is no longer supported starting with
``iomanager`` version 0.4.0.
