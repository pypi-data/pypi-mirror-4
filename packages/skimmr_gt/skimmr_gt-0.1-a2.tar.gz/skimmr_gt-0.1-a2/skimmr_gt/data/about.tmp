  <p>
  SKIMMR is a research prototype aimed at helping users to navigate through
  large amounts of textual data efficiently. This is done by extending the
  traditional paradigm of searching and browsing of text collections. SKIMMR
  lets the user 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading#Skimming">skim</a> 
  texts by navigating a network of concepts and relations explicitly or
  implicitly present in them. The concepts and their relations have been 
  extracted and inferred from the textual content using novel machine reading 
  techniques that power the SKIMMR back-end. 
  </p>

  <p>
  The interconnected `skimming networks' provide a high-level overview of the 
  domain covered by the texts, and let the user quickly discover interesting 
  pieces of information. This process also largely reduces the burden of 
  sieving through lots of irrelevant resources, which is often the down side
  of using the standard search engines. When the users identify interesting 
  information within the high level overview, they can continue reading the 
  related textual resources in detail.
  </p>

  <!--<p>
  This particular instance of SKIMMR has been deployed on a corpus of about
  1,200 abstracts and several dozens of full-text articles related to the 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_muscular_atrophy">SMA</a> 
  disease. The corpus was compiled by SMA experts using the 
  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">PubMed</a> repository of life 
  science articles. Once the users finish skimming, i.e., navigating the 
  network of concepts and relations extracted from the SMA articles, they
  can easily browse and read the related publications. This is done using an 
  embedded window with PubMed results focused on the articles most relevant 
  to the concepts discovered when skimming the data. Specific examples that 
  illustrate the way SKIMMR works are provided in the following section.

    <br/>
  </center>

  <h3>2.1. Logging in and/or Registering as a New User</h3><br/>

  <p>
  After pointing a browser to the SKIMMR web page, a login screen appears.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_login.png" alt="Login" 
  border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  Having a user name and password already, one can continue to the actual
  skim reading interface. If that is not the case, it is necessary to register 
  as a new user by following the corresponding link in the login screen. After 
  doing so, a registration/password change screen appears.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_register.png" 
  alt="Registration" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  In that screen, one can register as a new user. This is done by picking a 
  user name and password (leaving the old password blank), and optionally
  providing some background details. One can also change password of an 
  existing user by typing in the old password and picking a new one. 
  After a successful registration or password change, it is possible to 
  proceed back to the login screen and start skim reading.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2. Asking a Query</h3><br/>

  <p>
  After a successful login, one can ask SKIMMR about something (such as 
  <i>rain</i> in the example below).
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_query.png" alt="Querying" 
  border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  The queries can be terms, phrases or logical combinations of terms
  formulated in quite a rich 
  <a href="http://packages.python.org/Whoosh/querylang.html">fulltext search 
  syntax</a>. The
  <i>Max. nodes</i> and <i>Max. edges</i> menus can be used for 
  adjusting the maximum number of items displayed in one domain overview
  graph and the maximum number of links connecting the items, respectively. 
  </p>

  <h3>2.3. Browsing Query Results</h3><br/>
  
  <p>
  After entering a query into the search box in the previous screen, SKIMMR
  presents the user with two types of results. The first of them is a network 
  of entities extracted from the underlying articles.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_results-ent1.png" 
  alt="Results - entity network" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  The entities and the relations between them represent the most relevant 
  concepts related to the query term according to the analysed corpus of SMA 
  literature. The entities most relevant to the current query are displayed in
  bolder and larger fonts.
  </p>

  <p>
  There are two types of relationships connecting the entities:
  <ol>
   <li><b>general co-occurrence relations</b> (<i style="color:blue">blue</i> 
   edges in the graph) - these mean
   that the two entities connected by them occurred quite close to each 
   other in the texts and that such an occurrence was not just by chance;</li>
   <li><b>semantic relatedness</b> (<i style="color:red">red</i> edges in the 
   graph) - entities connected by this type of edges were found to be related 
   in terms of their meaning; although such things frequently also co-occur 
   with each other, it does not necessarily have to be so in general.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>2.4. Continuing Skimming</h3></br>

  <p>
  The nodes in the entity networks can be directly explored further, simply 
  using the <i>follow a link</i> menu as shown in the screenshot below.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_browse.png" alt="Browsing" 
  border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  Alternatively, one may go back to a previously asked query, using the 
  <i>history</i> menu.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_history.png" alt="History" 
  border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  Or, of course, it is possible to ask a new query that is completely unrelated
  to the currently displayed network or browsing history.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_newquery.png" 
  alt="New query" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  Any of the actions described above (exploring the networks related to the 
  entities displayed in the current results, going back in history or asking
  a new query) results into a new screen with a new entity network and updated 
  list of relevant publications - see below an example when picking 
  <i>brimstone</i>.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_results-ent2.png" 
  alt="New query" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  When exploring the entities linked to the query terms, one can perform a 
  web search for anything contained in the currently displayed network. 
  This can be done by selecting an entity in the <i>Entity look-up</i> area
  of the results page. Pushing the <i>Proceed</i> button initiates a Google
  search for the corresponding terms in another window or tab, as shown in
  the following screenshot (the <i>edom</i> term look up). 
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_results-lookup.png" 
  alt="New query" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  The <i>Related sources</i> area just next to <i>Entity look-up</i> serves
  for bringing up a list of paragraphs related to the current query results,
  as detailed in the following section.
  </p>

  <h3>2.5. Switching to Reading</h3></br>

  <p>
  After navigating through the high-level network representing the 
  domain covered by the text processed by SKIMMR, one can readily proceed
  with exploring the textual sources related to the results of skimming in more 
  detail. After refreshing the page with the results using the <i>Refresh</i>
  button in the <i>Related sources</i> area (see the previous section for a
  screenshot), an embedded frame with the most relevant paragraphs will
  be displayed, as shown in the following. 
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_results-prv.png" 
  alt="Results - related sources" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  This way one can quickly skim the domain of interest, find a 
  restricted set of relevant paragraphs and read them (with query-related 
  terms emphasised). 
  </p>

    <a name="evaluation"><h2>3. Notes on Evaluation</h2></a>
    <br/>
  </center>

  <p>
  Presently, we deployed SKIMMR mainly to test it with sample users in order 
  to evaluate the proof of concept of the underlying 
  technologies. Therefore we offer an opportunity to every user for giving us
  various forms of feedback. We also track certain user actions in order to 
  collect implicit feedback on typical user interaction patterns. Details are 
  summarised in the following sections. Note that while providing any kind of 
  explicit feedback is strictly optional, we will very much appreciate it, as 
  it will help us to improve the user experience in a more advanced future 
  version of SKIMMR.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1. Embedded Result-Specific Feedback Forms</h3><br/>

  <p>
  In the bottom of every screen that displays query results, there is the 
  following form.
  </p>

  <img style="margin-left:15px;" src="/data/html/about_feedback.png" 
  alt="Result feedback form" border="1"/>
    <br/><br/>

  <p>
  In that form, one can provide several types of rating for both result types
  (i.e., the entity network and the paragraphs related to the current query). 
  The dimensions of the rating go as follows:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Relevant / Irrelevant</b></li> Is the result relevant to the query
    asked? Or does it contain mostly information that does not seem to
    be related to a possible answer?
    <li><b>Enlightening / Obvious</b></li> Is there something new, surprising, 
    useful and/or particularly interesting among the results? Or are the 
    results perhaps relevant and correct, but otherwise not too exciting due 
    to their obvious nature?
    <li><b>Accurate / Noisy</b></li> Are the results generally correct, or do 
    they contains an unacceptable amount of noise (i.e., entities that may be 
    correct terms but do not refer to a significant domain-specific concept, 
    or utterly non-sensical entries)?
    <li><b>Concise / Redundant</b></li> Do the results present a wide coverage
    of multiple aspects of an answer to the query, or is there a lot of things
    that mean pretty much the same?
  </ol>
  Apart of ticking the check-boxes reflecting the user's general feeling
  about the results, one can also provide more detailed comments in the 
  corresponding text box. The feedback will get recorded as soon as the 
  <i>Submit</i> button is pressed, or when the user proceeds to another result 
  screen. 
  </p>

  <h3>3.2. History Tracking</h3><br/>
  
  <p>
  For each user, we track the history of their queries (apart of the feedback
  they may explicitly provide for particular results). The time stamp, the 
  query itself and the values of maximum nodes/edges parameters are being 
  recorded. No personal information is being stored about any user, unless 
  provided by the users themselves during the registration. We do not attempt
  to infer any personal details from the query information being stored. The
  sole purpose of the query history tracking is two-fold:
  <ol>
    <li>Anonymous statistical analysis of the general patterns in the user 
    behaviour (e.g., convergence or divergence of the common paths when 
    browsing the entity networks, or the conditions associated with switching 
    between skimming and reading).</li>
    <li>Correlation of the usability feedback with the actual user 
    behaviour.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>3.3. Usability Questionnaire</h3><br/>

  <p>
  Users can participate fill in an additional 
  <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B75T6P6">survey</a> (preferably after
  spending some time playing around with SKIMMR). The survey's estimated time
  burden is max. 15 minutes, and it is meant to collect basic feedback on the 
  usability of SKIMMR via a set of questions on:
  <ul>
    <li>the user's background (in relation to browsing of biomedical 
   literature);</li>
   <li>general user experience with the tool;</li>
   <li>usability issues specific to skim reading;</li>
   <li>comparison with state of the art services.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
