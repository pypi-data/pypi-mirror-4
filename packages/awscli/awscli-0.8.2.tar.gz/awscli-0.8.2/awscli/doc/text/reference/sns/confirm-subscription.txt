confirm-subscription
********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The confirm-subscription action verifies an endpoint owner's intent to
receive messages by validating the token sent to the endpoint by an
earlier subscribe action. If the token is valid, the action creates a
new subscription and returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This call
requires an AWS signature only when the --authenticate-on-unsubscribe
flag is set to "true".


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws sns confirm-subscription
     --token <value>
     --topic-arn <value>
     [--authenticate-on-unsubscribe <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--token"  (string)
   Short-lived token sent to an endpoint during the subscribe action.

"--topic-arn"  (string)
   The ARN of the topic for which you wish to confirm a subscription.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--authenticate-on-unsubscribe"  (string)
   Indicates that you want to disallow unauthenticated unsubscribes of
   the subscription. If value of this parameter is "true" and the
   request has an AWS signature then only the topic owner and the
   subscription owner will be permitted to unsubscribe the endpoint.
   The unsubscribe action will require AWS authentication.
