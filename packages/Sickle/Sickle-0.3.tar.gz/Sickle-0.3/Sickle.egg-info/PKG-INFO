Description: Sickle: An OAI Client Library for Python
        ========================================
        
        
        Sickle is lightweight `OAI-PMH <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html>`_
        client library written in Python.  It has been designed for conveniently retrieving
        data from OAI interfaces the Pythonic way::
        
            >>> sickle = Sickle('http://elis.da.ulcc.ac.uk/cgi/oai2')
            >>> records = sickle.ListRecords(metadataPrefix='oai_dc')
        
        Most importantly, Sickle lets you iterate through OAI records without having to deal
        with things like result batches or ``resumptionTokens`` yourself::
        
            >>> records.next()
            <Record oai:eprints.rclis.org:4088>
