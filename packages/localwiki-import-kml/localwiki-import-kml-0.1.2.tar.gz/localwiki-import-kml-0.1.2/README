Testing out a KML importer using the LocalWiki API.  Rough right now.

To install:

    $ pip install localwiki-import-kml

To run:

    Make sure you have either the geodjango requirements (GEOS, GDAL, PROJ.4)
    or localwiki installed.  If you've got a development install of localwiki,
    make sure you're inside of the localwiki virtualenv.  Then just run:
    
    $ localwiki-import-kml
