Description: Website crawling utility
        ----------------------------
        
        Leechi is a robust and sneaky wrapper for urllib2.
        
        It is sneaky because it introduces
        random delays between requests
        and because it changes its User Agent string.
        
        It is robust because it will automatically retry failed requests.
        
        Additionally, it will handle cookies to make session handling
        easier or even automatic.
        
        See website for usage information.
        
        Leechi development was sponsored by the Forschungsdaten Service Center
        of Universit√§t Mannheim, Germany <http://service.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/>.
