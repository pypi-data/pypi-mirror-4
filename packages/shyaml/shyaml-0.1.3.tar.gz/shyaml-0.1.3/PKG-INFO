       |SHYAML: YAML for the command line

       |
       |
       |Disclaimer
       |==========
       |
       |This scripts was written very quickly and will not support all YAML
       |manipulation that you could have dreamed of. But it should support
       |some handy basic query of YAML file.
       |
       |Please take a look at the next section to get a quick overview of
       |``shyaml`` capabilities.
       |
       |
       |Description
       |===========
       |
       |Simple scripts that allow read access to YAML files through command line.
       |
       |This can be handy, if you want to get access to YAML data in your shell
       |scripts.
       |
       |
       |Installation
       |============
       |
       |This script could be used out of the box, take the ``shyaml`` file and use it
       |directly.
       |
       |If you want to use the distribution method I've chosen, which is ``distutils2``,
       |please first make sure you have ``distutils2``, in which case you could do a:
       |
       |     ./autogen.sh
       |     pysetup install shyaml
       |
       |
       |Usage
       |=====
       |
       |``shyaml`` takes its YAML input file from standard input ONLY. So there are
       |some sample routine:
       |
       |Let's create a sample yaml file::
       |
       |    $ cat <<EOF > test.yaml
       |    name: "MyName !!"
       |    subvalue:
       |        how-much: 1.1
       |        how-many: 2
       |        things:
       |            - first
       |            - second
       |            - third

       |            Line 1
       |            Line 2
       |    EOF
       |
       |Simple query of simple attribute::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value name
       |    MyName !!
       |
       |Query nested attributes::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.how-much
       |    1.1
       |
       |Get type of attributes::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-type name
       |    str
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.how-much
       |    float
       |
       |Get sub YAML from a structure attribute::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-type subvalue
       |    struct
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue
       |    description: 'Multiline description:

       |    things:
       |    - first
       |    - second
       |    - third
       |
       |Query a list::
       |
       |   $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.things
       |   - first
       |   - second
       |   - third
       |   $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.things.0
       |   first
       |   $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.things.-1
       |   third
       |   $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.things.5
       |   Error: list index error in path 'subvalue.things.5'.
       |
       |Useless fun::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue | shyaml get-value things
       |    - first
       |    - second
       |    - third
       |
       |A Quick remainder of what is available::
       |
       |    $ shyaml
       |    usage:
       |        shyaml get-value KEY
       |        shyaml get-type KEY
       |        shyaml keys
       |Changelog
       |=========
       |
       |0.1.3 (2013-03-29)
       |------------------
       |
       |Fix
       |~~~
       |
       |- Removed the spurious line feed at the end of any ``shyaml`` output.
       |  [Valentin Lab]
       |
       |- Support querying for... nothing. Which now returns the whole input
       |  YAML. [Valentin Lab]
       |
       |  Before this fix, you couldn't ask for ``shyaml get-value`` alone, even
       |  if it makes sense but is completely useless as it returns the whole
       |  YAML input.
