            <div id="main_content">
                <h1>0.9-pre2 Up For Testing, Docs Too</h1>
                	<p>First off, my apologies to everyone if your <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader went crazy today.
I include documentation changes in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed so that people can
easily track updates to the Lamson docs.  However, that means when I&#8217;m
writing a lot of documentation it hits the feed repeatedly.</p>

	<p>The good news though is that you can now get at the 0.9-pre2 release of
Lamson from the <a href="/releases/">releases</a> page and you can read the great
new documentation I&#8217;ve got.</p>

	<p>Simply go to the <a href="/docs/">documentation</a> list and go through.  You&#8217;ll
want to check out <a href="/docs/lamson_virtual_env.html">how to install Lamson in a
virtualenv</a> by Zachary Voase.  You&#8217;ll
also want to read through the current draft of the <a href="/docs/getting_started.html">getting
started</a> as it covers all the nitty gritty
things you need.</p>

	<h2>Migrating To 0.9</h2>

	<p>I&#8217;m getting the 0.9 pre-releases out so that people can start
migrating and feeding me problems they encounter.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll have a full list of changes and some documentation on
migrating to 0.9.  The main things that changed are covered
in the <a href="/docs/getting_started.html">getting started</a> documentation,
notably how Lamson is configured and how routing works.  Routing
is the biggest change of all so read through it.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;ll have documentation on exactly how Routing works and
how to use it too coming soon.</p>

	<p>If you started using Lamson at the 0.8.x level and need help
migrating <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> and I&#8217;ll help you out.
Migration should involve just tagging your state functions with
the right route decorators.</p>

	<h2>Mailing List Is Dead, Long Live <span class="caps">OSB</span></h2>

	<p>I really didn&#8217;t like the way I did the mailinglist example, so
rather than keep it alive I just killed it and will rewrite it
after 0.9.  In its place is the <em>examples/osb</em> application which 
is a One-Shot-Blog.  You send it an email and it makes a blog
page and index for it.  It&#8217;s simple enough for everyone to
comprehend and I&#8217;ll be able to cover it in documentation easily.</p>

	<p>The <span class="caps">OSB</span> sample has all the right stuff for you to see how all of
Lamson&#8217;s features work, so check it out and use it as the basis
for your own applications.</p>

	<p>You can get it by <a href="/releases/">downloading the source</a> and looking
in the examples/osb directory.</p>

	<h2>0.9 Probably This Weekend</h2>

	<p>I want to get all the documentation done for the 0.9 release
and finish the <strong>very</strong> last feature that it needs.  I&#8217;m hoping
to have that in the next few days, at least by Monday.</p>

	<p>The only feature remaining for 0.9 is a SQLAlchemy based state
storage, and maybe a shelf based one.  Lamson now stores its 
state in an abstract <a href="/docs/api/lamson.routing.StateStorage-class.html">StateStorage</a> class that lets you store state however you need.</p>

	<p>Right now all that&#8217;s implemented is a <a href="/docs/api/lamson.routing.MemoryStorage-class.html">MemoryStorage</a> which actually works well enough
for most applications that you just start off, and is great for
unit testing.  But, there needs to be a permanent state store
support.</p>
