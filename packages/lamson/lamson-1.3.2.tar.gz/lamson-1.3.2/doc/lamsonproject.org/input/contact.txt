Title: Getting Help With Lamson

There are "mailing lists":/lists/ available (running Lamson of course) that you can join
to get help.  Keep in mind that these lists are running Lamson, and since Lamson is still a
work in progress they might be faulty.

The best way to get help with Lamson is to email me directly.  You can send
mail to "zedshaw@zedshaw.com":mailto:zedshaw@zedshaw.com to ask for help.
