        ========================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `JavaScript Load Image`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`JavaScript Load Image`: http://blueimp.github.com/JavaScript-Load-Image/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.javascript_load_image``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        You can import ``load_image`` from ``js.javascript_load_image`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.javascript_load_image import load_image
          >>> load_image.need()
