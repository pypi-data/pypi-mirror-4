        Tools to make analyzing HMDA data much easier.
        
        HMDA
        ----
        
        "HMDA" refers to the `Home Mortgage Disclosure Act`_, a law that requires
        financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home
        purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications. This data is made public and is available from the US Government at the `FFIEC HMDA Products`_ site.
