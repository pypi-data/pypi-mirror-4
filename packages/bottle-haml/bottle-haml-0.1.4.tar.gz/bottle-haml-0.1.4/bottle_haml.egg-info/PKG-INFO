Description: # bottle-haml
        
        An extension for using [Haml templates](http://haml.info/) in your [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org) applications.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `bottle-haml` is available via PIP:
        
            pip install bottle-haml
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once installed, use is simple. Simply import the helper method `haml_template` as follows:
        
            from bottlehaml import haml_template
        
        From there, usage is exactly the same as Bottle's built-in `template` method except it will search for files with the extension `.haml` and parse them as Haml.
        
            @route('/')
            def index():
                headlines = [
                    "Tree Stuck in Cat, Firefighters Baffled",
                    "Local Pet Spider, Silky, Missing"
                ]
                return haml_template('index', headlines=headlines)
        
        ## Haml reference
        
        `bottle-haml` uses the [PyHaml](https://github.com/mikeboers/PyHAML) module to parse Haml into the Mako templates that Bottle uses. For a reference of the Haml syntax supported please see the PyHaml project's GitHub page.
