delete-pipeline
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Permanently deletes a pipeline, its pipeline definition and its run
history. You cannot query or restore a deleted pipeline. AWS Data
Pipeline will attempt to cancel instances associated with the pipeline
that are currently being processed by task runners. Deleting a
pipeline cannot be undone.

To temporarily pause a pipeline instead of deleting it, call  set-
status with the status set to Pause on individual components.
Components that are paused by set-status can be resumed.
