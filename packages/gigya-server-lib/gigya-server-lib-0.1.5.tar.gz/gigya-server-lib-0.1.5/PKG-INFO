Description: ================
        Gigya Server Lib
        ================
        
        **Notice: This work is not sponsored or otherwise acknowledged by Gigya Inc in any way shape or form.**
        
        Gigya Server Lib (gslib) is a python adaptation of the `Gigya Server SDK <http://developers.gigya.com/030_Server_SDKs>`_ to python.
        
        Typical Usage
        =============
        
        Properly initialized, gslib is very simple to use::
        
            # Make a request to gigya (retrieve a user's data from GCS)
            gslib.Request('gcs.getUserData',
                          params={"UID": '<user UID>', "fields": "*"},
                          use_https=True).send()
            
            # Verify an event's signature (gigya_dict contains a json response 
            # loaded to a dict with json.loads)
            # See: http://bit.ly/NZ2Bpc
            gslib.SigUtils.signature_validate(gigya_dict['signatureTimestamp'],
                                                gigya_dict['UID'],
                                                gigya_dict['UIDSignature'])
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install Gigya Server Lib, simply: ::
        
            $ pip install gigya-server-lib
        
        Or, if you're running on an old and busted environment: ::
        
            $ easy_install gigya-server-lib
        
        
        Initialization
        --------------
        
        If used inside a django application gslib will automatically look for the following settings::
        
            settings.GIGYA_API_KEY
            settings.GIGYA_SECRET_KEY
        
        If used inside a flask application, initialization can be done by calling ``gslib.initialize_app``, gslib will expect similar keys on the flask app's config (``GIGYA_API_KEY`` and ``GIGYA_SECRET_KEY``).
        
        Otherwise the api key and secret key can be sent as arguments to the constructor of a ``gslib.Request``.
