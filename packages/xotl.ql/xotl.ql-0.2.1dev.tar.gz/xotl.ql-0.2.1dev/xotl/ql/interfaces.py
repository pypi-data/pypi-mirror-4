    not implements an `__eq__` method or returns `NotImplemented`, Python
    fallbacks to call the method `__eq__` for `expr2`.

    .. todo::

       Currently we only support :class:`ITerm` instances as generators, since
       allowing the `next` protocol directly over :term:`query objects <query
