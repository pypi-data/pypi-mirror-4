        =====
        
        Yaybu is a configuration management tool written in Python with the goal of
        helping you tame your servers, and we want you to do it with a smile.
        
        You describe your infrastructure in a simple and flexible YAML-like language
        and Yaybu works out what needs to happen to deploy your updates.
        
        We are on OFTC IRC (``irc://irc.oftc.net/yaybu``). Our docs are at
        ``yaybu.readthedocs.org``.
        
        
        Hacking on yaybu
        ================
        
        To get a development environment with required dependencies::
        
            python bootstrap.py
            bin/buildout
        
        Then write a sample config file called ``foo.yay``::
        
            resources.append:
              - File:
                  name: /some_empty_file
        
              - Execute:
                  name: hello_world
                  command: touch /hello_world
                  creates: /hello_world
        
        And run it with::
        
            ./bin/yaybu foo.yay
        
        
        Running the tests
        -----------------
        
        NOTE: Currently the testrunner will try and run a set of integration tests
        against an ubuntu chroot. Because of that we are a bit ubuntu-specific.
        We'll be fixing that asap!
        
        To run the tests::
        
            ./bin/test discover
