.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified LoadBalancer.
.sp
If attempting to recreate the LoadBalancer, the client must reconfigure all the
settings. The DNS name associated with a deleted LoadBalancer will no longer be
usable. Once deleted, the name and associated DNS record of the LoadBalancer no
longer exist and traffic sent to any of its IP addresses will no longer be
delivered to client instances. The client will not receive the same DNS name
even if a new LoadBalancer with same \-\-load\-balancer\-name is created.
.sp
To successfully call this API, the client must provide the same account
credentials as were used to create the LoadBalancer.
.IP Note
By design, if the LoadBalancer does not exist or has already been deleted,
delete\-load\-balancer still succeeds.
