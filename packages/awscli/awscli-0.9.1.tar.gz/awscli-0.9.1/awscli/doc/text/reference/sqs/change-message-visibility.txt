change-message-visibility
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The "change-message-visibility" action changes the visibility timeout
of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum allowed
timeout value you can set the value to is 12 hours. This means you
can't extend the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more
than a total visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information
visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer
Guide.)

For example, let's say you have a message and its default message
visibility timeout is 30 minutes. You could call
"ChangeMessageVisiblity" with a value of two hours and the effective
timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that time comes near
you could again extend the time out by calling ChangeMessageVisiblity,
but this time the maximum allowed timeout would be 9 hours and 30
minutes.

Warning: If you attempt to set the "--visibility-timeout" to an amount more
  than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not
  automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum
  time remaining.

Warning: Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a
  specific message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is
  not saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message
  after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message the
  next time it is received reverts to the original timeout value, not
  the value you set with the change-message-visibility action.
