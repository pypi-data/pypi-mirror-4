create-customer-gateway
***********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device. The
customer gateway is the appliance at your end of the VPN connection
(compared to the VPN gateway, which is the device at the AWS side of
the VPN connection). You can have a single active customer gateway per
AWS account (active means that you've created a VPN connection to use
with the customer gateway). AWS might delete any customer gateway that
you create with this operation if you leave it inactive for an
extended period of time.

You must provide the Internet-routable IP address of the customer
gateway's external interface. The IP address must be static.

You must also provide the device's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Autonomous System Number (ASN). You can use an existing ASN assigned
to your network. If you don't have an ASN already, you can use a
private ASN (in the 64512 - 65534 range). For more information about
ASNs, go to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_%28Internet%29 .
