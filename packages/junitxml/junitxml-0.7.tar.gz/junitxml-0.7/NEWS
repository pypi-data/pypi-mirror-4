0.7
===

* Added a .testr.conf file for running tests with testrepository.

* Change from skip to skipped to fit the 'standard' better.
  (Leo Arias, #982293)

* There is now a runner compatible with the unittest2 command line options, for
  easy 'just give me XML' usage. (Duncan Findlay)

0.6
===

* Exception types no longer list special modules like ``exceptions`` or
  ``builtins`` (Martin[gz]).

* Invalid XML should be less likely to be generated: bad cdata is stripped and
  attributes are escaped differently to content. (Martin[gz], lp:625589)

* Python 2.7 fixes, and output xfails as success, and unexpected successes as
  failures. (Martin[gz], lp:506340)

* Python 3.x compatibility should be restored (Martin[gz], Robert Collins)

* Test ids are now split into 'class' and 'name' more carefully, so that ids
  which have flavours in brackets are not split inside the flavour. For
  instance bzrlib.tests.test_foo.TestFoo.test_thing(flavor-1.6) will now
  be split into bzrlib.tests.test_foo.TestFoo and test_thing(flavor-1.6).
  (Martin[gz])

* There is now a __version__ attribute on junitxml. (Robert Collins)

0.5
===

* Use a timezone aware datetime, because subunit generates tz aware datetimes
  (John Arbash Meinel, lp:481119)

* Use the earliest known time as the start of the test run rather than simply
  the time when the test run started, giving sensible results when replaying
  recorded subunit streams in subunit2junitxml. (Robert Collins)

0.4
===

* Set the tests count in the xml correctly. (Matt Mason, Robert Collins,
  lp:484800)

0.3
===

* Support addSkip on pythons where unittest does not support it yet.
  (Robert Collins, lp:435400)
