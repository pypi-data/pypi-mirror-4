Description: GS Export
        =========
        
        GS Export is a little helper that dumps your GenericSetup profile
        to a given directory, and sends you a mail, if anything has changed
        since it was last run.
        
        GS Export uses git to store the change history, it simply sends the result
        of a ``git status -q`` if there are any changes.
        It is your responsabilility to commit the changes, else you will get the
        same notification on the next run.
        
        GS Export always sends a passwort with each request, it is POST encoded
        but it is still there. This also means, it needs basic auth working on your
        plone site. You might want to run GS Export only on the same machine
        as the zope client.
        
        GS Export needs to be configured, and it needs a lot of options.
        Since GS Export might be needed for many sites on one host, it does not
        look for a configuration file with a fixed name, but you must provide
        a configuration file as the first argument to the script.
        This is a sample configuration. All arguments are required::
        
          [gs_export]
          base_url = http://yoursite:8080/Plone/portal_setup
          user = youruser
          password = yourpass
          path = /absolute_path_to_dump_diretory_of_git
          mail_server = your.mailserver
          mail_port = 587
          mail_user = your_mail_user
          mail_password= your_mail_pass
          mail_from = your_email_adress
          mail_mode = TLS
          mail_recipient=your_receiving_email_adress
          ignore = structure
              workflow
        
        - base_url must point to portal_setup
        - the path must exist
        - mail_mode accepts an empty string, TLS and SSL
        - This tool only accepts one mail recipient. This could easily by changed though
        - ignore accepts multiple parameters. Ignore means, after dumping the
          configuration, the ignore parts are deleted! It is a good idea to ignore
          structure. Multiple values can be added by adding one for each line
          and indenting the elements
        
        GS Export is intended to be run by a cron job. 
        
        Todo
        ----
        - Allow for multiple recipients.
