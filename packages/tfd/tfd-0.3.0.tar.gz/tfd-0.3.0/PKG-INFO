Description: 
        ## Introduction
        
        `tfd` is a python package containing a variety of modules that do not seem to
        warrant their own distribution or package.  It provides a convenient namespace
        to avoid conflicts with other modules and packages out there.
        
        This package is _alpha_ and its API is not stable.
