list-metrics
************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns a list of valid metrics stored for the AWS account owner.
Returned metrics can be used with "get-metric-statistics" to obtain
statistical data for a given metric.

Note: Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve further
  results, use returned "--next-token" values with subsequent "list-
  metrics" operations.

Note: If you create a metric with the  put-metric-data action, allow up to
  fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to the "list-
  metrics" action.
