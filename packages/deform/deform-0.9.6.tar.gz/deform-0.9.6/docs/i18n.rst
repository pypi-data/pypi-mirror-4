Internationalization
====================

Deform is fully internationalizable and localizable.  :term:`gettext`
``.mo.`` files exist in the :mod:`deform` and :mod:`colander` packages
which contain (currently incomplete) translations to various languages
for the purpose of rendering localized error messages.

See the `Internationalization demo
<http://deformdemo.repoze.org/i18n/>`_ for an example of how deform
error and status messages can be localized.  This demonstration uses
the `internationalization and localization features of Pyramid
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/1.0/narr/i18n.html>`_
to render Deform error messages into :term:`Chameleon` form renderings.
