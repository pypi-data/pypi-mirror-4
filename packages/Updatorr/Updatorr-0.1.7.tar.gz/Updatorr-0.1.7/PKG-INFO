        What's that
        -----------
        
        *deluge-updatorr is a Deluge plugin for automatic torrents updates.*
        
        If you're periodically checking your favourite torrent tracker site,
        on which torrents are organized as articles (i.e forum-like tracker),
        to verify whether specific torrents have been updated (e.g. torrent
        bundling some TV-series is updated with a new episode), then Updatorr
        is might be of use.
        
        You activate Updatorr plugin, set autoupdate period and trackers sites
        credentials, choose torrents to be updated from Deluge torrents list,
        and Updatorr will do checks for you. When torrent update is available,
        Updatorr will replace old torrent with an updated one, and download
        new files from new torrent.
        
        Automatic updates are available for:
        
            * RuTracker.org (ex torrents.ru) - http://rutracker.org/
            * RUTOR - http://rutor.org/
            * AniDUB - http://tr.anidub.com/
        
        *Deluge is a lightweight, Free Software, cross-platform BitTorrent client.*
        Download it at http://deluge-torrent.org/
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Open Deluge, go to "Preferences -> Plugins -> Install plugin" and choose
        Updatorr .egg file.
        
        If you are to build .egg file from source code yourself use
        `python setup.py bdist_egg` command in source code root directory.
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        Q: I installed Updatorr and checked it on plugins page, but Updatorr
        page is not shown in preferences dialog.
        
        A: 1. Verify that you downloaded and installed Updatorr for the same Python
              version your Deluge is working on. Updatorr is available from PyPI
              in distribution for Python 2.7.
        
           2. Verify that `python-setuptools` package is installed.
        
        
        Q: It seems that Updatorr doesn't work with my OS/Python/Deluge/GTK+ versions.
        
        A: Updatorr is developed and used with Ubuntu 11.10, Python 2.7, Deluge 1.3.3, GTK+ 2.24.
        It may or may not work with other software. Anyway you're always welcome to improve Updatorr
        to support those (see `Get involved` section down below).
        
        
        
        Trackers Handlers
        -----------------
        
        *The information below is intended for those wishing to
        enable Updatorr autoupdates for their favourite tracker site.*
        
        In order to perform automatic updates Updatorr should be instructed
        how to perform those, as different torrent tracking sites require
        different machinery to get updated torrents.
        
        Tracker handlers are nothing more as relatively simple scripts
        in great Python programming language.
        
        To create a tracker handler class one needs to:
        
            0. Have essential knowledge in Python programming;
            1. Get Updatorr source code from http://github.com/idlesign/deluge-updatorr/;
            2. Create ``hander_{mytracker}.py`` file under `updatorr/tracker_handlers/`;
            3. In that file subclass ``BaseTrackerHandler`` and implement
               its ``get_torrent_file()`` method;
               Note: See base class properties and methods, as they might be of use.
            4. In that file register you class with ``register_tracker_handler()``.
        
        Tracker handler sample `updatorr/tracker_handlers/handler_mytrack.py`::
        
            from updatorr.handler_base import BaseTrackerHandler
            from updatorr.utils import register_tracker_handler
        
            class MyTrackHandler(BaseTrackerHandler):
        
                # Let's suppose that tracker site doesn't require authorization.
                login_required = False
        
                def get_torrent_file(self):
                    # Here one should implement .torrent file download and
                    # save into filesystem. See BaseTrackerHandler fo helper methods.
                    torrent_filepath = '/somewhere/in/my/filesystem/new.torrent'
                    return torrent_filepath
        
            register_tracker_handler('mytrackaurl.com', MyTrackHandler)
            register_tracker_handler('yotr.su', MyTrackHandler)
        
        It is not that as if only the `BaseTrackerHandler` class is at your service.
        You can speed up your development using `GenericTrackerHandler`, `GenericPublicTrackerHandler`
        and `GenericPrivateTrackerHandler` classes, each on which introduces different levels of abstraction.
        
        See `updatorr/tracker_handlers/handler_rutracker.py` and `updatorr/handler_base.py` for reference.
        Read docstrings of Updatorr.
