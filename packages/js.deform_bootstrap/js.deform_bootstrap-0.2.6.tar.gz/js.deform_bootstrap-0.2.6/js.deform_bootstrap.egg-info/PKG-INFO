Description: js.deform_bootstrap
        ===================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `deform_bootstrap`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`deform_bootstrap`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/deform_bootstrap/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.deform_bootstrap``) are published to some URL.
        
        Included resources
        ------------------
        
        ``js.deform_bootstrap`` is different from most ``js.`` packages in that it
        doesn't include any resources itself.  It references the resources from
        ``deform_bootstrap`` instead.
        
        Usage in Pyramid
        ----------------
        
        To use this package in `Pyramid`_ you have to include the following
        packages::
        
          deform_bootstrap
          js.deform
          js.deform_bootstrap
        
        .. caution::
        
          `js.deform_bootstrap` must be included **after** `js.deform` as it
          overrides some parts of its configuration.
        
        .. _`Pyramid`: http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``deform_bootstrap_js`` from ``js.deform_bootstrap``
        and ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.deform_bootstrap import deform_bootstrap_js
          >>> deform_bootstrap_js.need()
