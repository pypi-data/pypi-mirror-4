Description: 
        Padlock is a Python library that provides a lock through a single, simple interface and offers several backends
        (actually, for now, only one, until someone `contributes another <http://github.com/samuraisam/padlock>`_) so
        you can choose the backend that best fits your needs.
        
        It's really easy to use. Here, for example, is how to create a cassandra row lock::
        
            >>> import padlock, pycassa
            >>> pool = pycassa.ConnectionPool('my_keyspace')
            >>> with padlock.get('cassandra, pool=pool, column_family='my_column_family'):
            ...    do_important_shit()
            "success!"
        
        Huzzah!
