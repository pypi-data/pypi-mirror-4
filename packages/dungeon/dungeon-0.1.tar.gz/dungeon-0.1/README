this is cde i wrote for the exercice 46 of the pyhonthehardway by Zed Shaw

the purpose of this is to see if i can create a little package that has a script installed too.


usage example : 

   >>> from dungeon import printlist
   >>> printlist("argument")
   
1. from the root directory (dungeon) do the following (after having installed pip, distribute, virtualenv, nose)

python setup.py

2. This create aa dist/ directory with dungeon... tarball directory.

3. copy the tarball to ~/testing/

4. from ~/testing/ directory run

sudo pip install dungeon....(the tarball file)

5. from same directory run 

testprint.py
   

some many thing i do not understand with the python 2.6 it display the following :

a list of things
['milk', 'bread', 'carrot', 'cheese', 'butter', 'yogurt']

with python2.7 :

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testprint.py", line 3, in <module>
    from dungeon import printlist
ImportError: No module named dungeon
