Introduction: pCanary basic purpose
========================================

pCanary is a opensource application that is used to lookup information on
crafting and ores in the game Minecraft. It is written in Python and should 
be compatible with most operating systems however it has been built for 
Linux.

pCanary will create a tk window that will become the interface of selecting
different ores and recipes by the user. The tk window will give the user
an idea on how to construct the crafting on a grid and it will also show
the different ores and their purpose.

pCanary was written by Jeremiah O'Neal aka we6jbo and is released under
the GNU general public license
