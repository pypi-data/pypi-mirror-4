Description: Shaker: A Salt Minion Factory for EC2 Instances
        ===============================================
        
        Shaker is BSD-New Licensed command-line application to launch Salt
        minions as Amazon EC2 instances.
        
        `Salt <http://saltstack.org>`_ is a powerful remote execution
        manager that can be used to administer servers in a fast and
        efficient way.
        
        Running an Amazon EC2 instance as a Salt minion is fairly simple.
        Also tedious, if you need to launch minions often.  Shaker bridges
        the gap between launching an EC2 instance and bootstrapping it as
        a Salt minion.
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Shaker is usually run from the command line.  To start a Salt minion,
        have it connect upon boot to Salt master *salt.example.com*:
        
        ::
        
            $ shaker --distro ubuntu --master salt.example.com
        
            Started Instance: i-9175d8f4
        
            To access: ssh ubuntu@ec2-107-20-93-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com
            To terminate: shaker-terminate i-9175d8f4
