Title: Lamson 0.9.5, The Push To 1.0

I just released Lamson 0.9.5 with all the major Unicode refactoring done and working.
This is an important release because 0.9.5 is where I declare that I'm pushing to a 1.0 
release and the base Lamson "APIs":/docs/api/ won't change under penalty of death.  In fact they can't
change because I'm using them myself in a few applications.

From now on, if an API has to change, then I'll keep the old one around and attach a 
deprecation warning, and then provide a new one.  You'll then have by 1.0 to stop using
it and start using the new one.  Except for a situations where a bug must be fixed, I
can't see the actual Lamson API needing such a drastic change by 1.0.

What will happen between now and 1.0 is bug fixing, and adding any nice additional 
features people need within the current "API":/docs/api/ to help build applications.
This would be things like more connectors to other mail protocols (LMTP, QPMP), commands
for deployment features, and possibly a way to write your own command.

So, if you've been waiting for the API to stabilize then 0.9.5 is the release to grab
and start using.  I'm currently using it on about 6 little projects and it's working
great so far, but I need more people to try it out and send me feedback on how well
it works for them.


h2. Getting This Release

As usual, you can read the "download":/download.html documentation to learn how to
grab it.

After you grab it, go read these documents:

* "Getting Started With Lamson":http://lamsonproject.org/docs/getting_started.html
* "A Painless Introduction To Finite State Machines":http://lamsonproject.org/docs/introduction_to_finite_state_machines.html
* "Deploying Lamson And OneShotBlog":http://lamsonproject.org/docs/deploying_lamson.html

Then you should hit the "API documentation":http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/ and 
start writing your application.  Keep your first one small and try deploying it
in different ways.


h2. Simple Virtualhost Deployment Instructions Coming Soon

The "oneshotblog.com":http://oneshotblog.com/ sample application is now deployed in a
new virtualhost configuration on a new VPS I purchased this week.  This configuration
is different from the ones given in the documentation above because it allows you 
to run mulitple applications for multiple domains on a single machine.

I'll be writing up how to build your own version of this configuration today, but the
quick description is this:

# I have postfix running on port 25 now *in front* of Lamson.
# Postfix is configured to take all mail for each domain and dump it into a maildir queue for each one.
# The Lamson applications are then reconfigured in their @config/boot.py@ to use a "QueueReceiver":http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.server.QueueReceiver-class.html to feed itself messages from its maildir.
# Lamson then just uses the same postfix server as its relay host like before.

The advantage of this configuration, apart from being able to easily host multiple domains, 
is that you can shutdown your Lamson application and when you start it back up it
will catch up on the mail in the maildir.  People will probably never know you did 
maintenance or stopped the server temporarily.

The disadvantage of this configuration is that it's a royal pain to make postfix do this.
The instructions will show you step-by-step how to pull it off, so hopefully it'll make
it easier on people who need it.  However, I'm gonna tell people to start small and
just use the simpler configuration "Lamson in front" configuration and leave this
for the big times.

h2. Mailing List Will Go Down

Finally, I'll be moving the mailing list shortly, so if you send a message and don't receive
a reply then that's why.
