PREREQUISITES:
    * hadoop (with libhdfs and all its jar files) installed 
        on a machine where library will be build
    * java installed 
    * Cython (maybe not needed if cyhdfs.cpp compiles fine with your hadoop version)

INSTALL:
    edit setup.cfg: set
    hadoop_home=base directory of hadoop
    include_dirs=libhdfs include path and java jni.h include path
    library_dirs and rpath=libhdfs.so and java shared library path

    hadoop_delete_recursive=1 -
        means hdfsDelete() has second parameter int recursive
        this is true for hadoop >= 0.20.2-cdh3u5

    hadoop_hflush=1 means libhdfs exports hdfsHFlush()
        this is true for hadoop == 0.20.2-cdh3u3
        as long as i know

    then install as always:

    python ./setup.py build
    sudo python ./setup.py install

    Running Tests:
    If you with to run tests -  please edit test/__init__.py
    and set namenode_host, port, and username in setUp() function
    then run:
        nosetests -s ./tests
    It is ok for tests.test_hflush to fail with hadoop >= 0.20.2-cdh3u5
    because there is no hflush call in this versions of hadoop and so 
    wrapper just does nothing.
