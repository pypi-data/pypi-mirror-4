        0.3.4
        -----
        
        * get_next_url now takes a default parameter. Pass default=None to return None
          if no suitable next URL can be found
        * get_next_url no longer looks in the session by default. Pass session=True to
          look in the session. This was added since popping next from session modifies
          the session.
        * load_models accepts 'g.<name>' notation for parameters to indicate that the
          parameter should be available as g.<name>. The view function will get called
          with just <name> as usual.
        * If the view requires permissions, load_models caches available permissions
          as g.permissions.
