Description: =========
        zkwatcher
        =========
        
        `zk_watcher` is a Python script that handles registration with an `Apache
        ZooKeeper` service.
        
        The goal of `zk_watcher` is to monitor a particular service on a host machine
        and register that machine as a `provider` of that service at a given path
        on the ZooKeeper service.
        
        A simple example is having `zk_watcher` monitor Apache httpd by running `service
        apache2 status` at a regular interval and registers with ZooKeeper at a given
        path (say `/services/production/webservers`). As long as the command returns
        a safe exit code (`0`), `zk_watcher` will register with ZooKeeper that this
        server is providing this particular service. If the hostname of the machine
        is `web1.mydomain.com`, the registration path would look like this ::
        
            /services/production/webservers/web1.mydomain.com:80
        
        In the event that the service check fails, the host will be immediately de-
        registered from that path.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, run ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        or ::
        
            pip install zk_watcher
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        To configure, edit the '/etc/zk/config.cfg' file. The file consists of sections
        that each point to a particular service you want to monitor and register with
        ZooKeeper. An example file is provided, but could look like this ::
        
            [ssh]
            cmd: /etc/init.d/sshd status
            refresh: 60
            service_port: 22
            zookeeper_path: /services/ssh
            zookeeper_data: 
        
            [apache]
            cmd: /etc/init.d/apache status
            refresh: 60
            service_port: 22
            zookeeper_path: /services/web
            zookeeper_data: 
        
            
        See the 'zk_watcher.rst' file for configuration and run-time options.
        
        Caveats
        -------
        Right now you must install this package as `root`, or you must create the
        `/etc/zk` directory ahead of time and change its ownership to your installation
        user name. The `setup.py` uses a hard-coded path (`/etc/zk/config.cfg`) for the
        config file, and will fail if it cannot create the file at that path. This will
        be fixed in the next version.
