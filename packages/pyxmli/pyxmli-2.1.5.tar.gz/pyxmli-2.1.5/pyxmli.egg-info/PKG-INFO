Description: PyXMLi helps Python developers generate invoices in XMLi 2.0 (http://www.xmli.org), the open-source invoice format designed by Greendizer (http://greendizer.com).
        
        Why another format?
        Simply because none of the available formats was good enough for what its creators needed it for.
        
        Design goals:
        -    Human-readable, Web-friendly format; 
        -    Carry data structures, not business logic;
        -    Stand-alone, with every detail possible from creation to archiving;
        -    Privilege existing standards whenever possible.
        
        Features:
        PyXMLi comes with a great deal of features to make it really easier for Python developers to:
        
        -    Generate XMLi 2.0 invoices in their favorite language;
        -    Strongly validate pretty much every field locally before sending their invoices; 
        -    Sign their invoices using the XMLDsig standard and a simple RSA key.
        
        Requirements:
        -    Python 2.5+
        -    lxml 2.3+
        -    PyCrypto 2.6+
        
        (Built-in setup will install all the dependencies automatically).
        
        Compatibility:
        PyXMLi is compatible with Google App Engine and their Python 2.7 runtime.
        
        Edit app.yaml to add pyCrypto and lxml to the list of third-party modules you'd like to use. 
        
            libraries:
            - name: pycrypto
              version: 2.6
            
            - name: lxml
              version: 2.3
        
        Setup:
        Using pip:
        
            sudo pip install --upgrade pyxmli
        
        Using easy_install:
        
            sudo easy_install --upgrade pyxmli
            
        Using source code:
