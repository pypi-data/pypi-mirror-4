delete-cluster-snapshot
***********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes the specified manual snapshot. The snapshot must be in the
"available" state.

Unlike automated snapshots, manual snapshots are retained even after
you delete your cluster. Amazon Redshift does not delete your manual
snapshots. You must delete manual snapshot explicitly to avoid getting
charged.
