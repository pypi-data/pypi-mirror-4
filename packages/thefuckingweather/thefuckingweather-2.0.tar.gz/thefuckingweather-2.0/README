----

The code is self-documenting so you shouldn't have any problem using it.
The basic way to use it, if you're including it in a program, is:

>>> import thefuckingweather
>>> thefuckingweather.get_weather("Hell, MI")

and you'll get lots of return data. The data format is documented under
get_weather(). You can also run it from a shell: this output is pretty
to the average user but can also be parsed by the likes of sed.

disclaimer), so please don't treat it as an actual weather reporting
system or as trustworthy.

Enjoy!
