Description: Quick-and-dirty obfuscation for strings, designed to
        hide URL parameters from the casual experimenter without
        adding too much length. A little randomness is baked
        in to make it look like the parameters are constantly
        changing, even if they're not.
        
        Obviously this is NOT SECURE; don't rely on it for strong secrecy.
        A chosen-plaintext attack will recover the key, just like xor.
        
        Only works for ASCII strings.  Not Unicode-safe.
