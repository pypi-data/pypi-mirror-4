Description: django-auth-additions
        ======================
        
        Adds some bits that help make django.contrib.auth a bit more useful.
        
        Group gains a 'rank' field, that can be used to rank groups (useful where
        groups need to be able to be limited to view only groups 'lower' than
        they are).
        
        Group gains a .duplicate() method, that will duplicate a group, including
        all of it's permissions.
        
        User gains methods for custom permissions:
           * can_view(object)
           * can_edit(object)
           * can_delete(object)
           * can_create(class)
        
        These will use the current permissions, but also allow for methods to be
        added on the object/class being tested, which can permit or deny access
        according to custom rules.  I use this for instance to only allow staff
        to view other staff who work at the same location(s).
        
        Future:
        * Configure using data from ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``
        * Unique email addresses
        * Non-nullable email
        * Index on email
        * Random username on save (or email?)
        * email in template (?)
