CalendarX is a customizable, open source metacalendar application written
for the Plone content management system on top of Zope and Python.

As open source software, it builds on the work of many other fine open source
products, and on the work of many individual contributors. At the very top of
the list are the creators of Python, Zope and Plone.  Without the fine
application development platform these provide, CalendarX would not exist.

In most cases, I have tried to adapt rather than adopt code from others, so that
CalendarX retains a fairly consistent internal style.  However, there are also
places where the code comes straight from the code of others.  I have tried to
mention contributors in the comments of the code wherever this is feasible.  I
will also try to keep a tally here of the individuals who have contributed in
some way, wittingly or not, to the success of this project.

Significant Code Contributors
=============================

* Oliver Merkel, who wrote the original PloneCalendar and produced a very
  thoughtful documentation for its installation.
* Alec Mitchell, who wrote the code to make CalendarX into a PloneFolder-based
  Product (0.4 branch), and made many other code suggestions, and now helps
  manage CalendarX at sourceforge along with even more kool kode kontributions.
* Scott Sturgeon, for makeCSV.py and addEvent code
* Joris Bauer for XHTML validity fixes throughout the 0.4 branch.
* Gaël Pegliasco for i18n kickstart to the 0.6 branch.
* George Lee for setting up the Collective SVN repository with EVERY earlier
  release of CalendarX set up as tagged releases. Fabulous job.
* Guy Heckman's CalendarX Patch Sprint at Penn State University in December
  2007, who says Eric Steele, Erik Rose, and Daryl Noye from WebLion deserve
  special kudos for their contributions.  Thanks to all the Sprinters, this gave
  us the /plone-3-compatibility branch in the Collective SVN that served as the
  real starting place for the 0.9.x branch of CalendarX... my earlier efforts
  have been happily discarded.
* Alex Clark, who started the Products.CalendarX repo
* Gilles Lenfant, who got CalendarX and eggification and refactoring restarted

Special coding inspiration
==========================

* Raphael Ritz for MySite and many listserv postings
* Dieter Maurer for AdvancedQuery and many listserv postings
* Casey Duncan for Monkey Patch explanation
* Jean Jordaan for Internationalization explanation

Monetary Contributors (thanks!)
===============================

* Several people and organizations have made donations through Sourceforge,
  which helps a lot because this is almost purely for hobby now, and an
  occasional consulting gig for customization help.
* Additionally, the late 2007 Fundable project gave me the funding to be able
  to get moving again.  Many contributors there, but I'll not release all
  their names.  Thanks SO much.
