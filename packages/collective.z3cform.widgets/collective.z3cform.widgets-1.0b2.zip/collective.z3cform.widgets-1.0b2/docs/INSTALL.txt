Installation
------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.z3cform.widgets`` to the list
   of eggs to install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.z3cform.widgets

2. You may need to extend a Dexterity known good set (KGS) to make sure that
   you get the right versions of the packages that make up Dexterity::

    [buildout]
    ...
    extends =
        http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.
