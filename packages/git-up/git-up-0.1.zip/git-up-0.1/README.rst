PyGitUp
=======

|Build Status|

``PyGitUp`` is a Python implementation of the great
`aanand/git-up/ <https://github.com/aanand/git-up/>`__. Right now it
fully covers the abilities of git-up and should be a drop-in
replacement.

Why using ``git up``?
---------------------

    git pull has two problems:

    * It merges upstream changes by default, when it's really more polite to rebase over them, unless your collaborators enjoy a commit graph that looks like bedhead. 

    * It only updates the branch you're currently on, which means git push will shout at you for being behind on branches you don't particularly care about right now.

Why using the Python port?
--------------------------

I wasn't able to use the original ``git-up``, because I didn't want to install
a whole Ruby suite just for `git-up` and even with Ruby installed, there were
some problems running on my Windows machine. So, my reasons for writing
and using this port are:

1. Windows support.
2. Written in Python ;)

Is it stable?
-------------

Yes, it should be stable now. If you nevertheless find errors, please
report them `here <https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp/issues>`__.

How do I install it?
--------------------

1. Run ``$ pip install git-up``
2. ``cd`` to your project's directory.
3. Run ``git up`` enjoy!

Note for Windows users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need ``pip`` installed and working. Check out
`SO#4750806 <http://stackoverflow.com/q/4750806/997063>`__ for more
information. And don't forget to either make your ``Python/Scripts`` and
``Python/Lib/site-packages`` writable for you or run ``pip`` with admin
privileges.

Compatibility note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``PyGitUp`` is not compatible with Python 3 because some essential 3rd party
libs don't support it. Sorry.

How to configure it?
--------------------

To configure ``PyGitUp``, you can set options in your git config. Run
``git config [--global] git-up.[name] [value]`` to set one of these
options:

-  ``git-up.bundler.check [true|*false*]:`` If set to
   ``true``,\ ``PyGitUp`` will check your app for any new bundled gems
   and suggest a ``bundle install`` if necessary.

-  ``git-up.bundler.autoinstall [true|*false*]:`` If set to
   ``true``,\ ``PyGitUp`` will run ``bundle install`` automatically.
   Requires ``git-up.bundler.check`` to be true.

-  ``git-up.fetch.prune [*true*|false]:`` If set to ``true``,
   ``PyGitUp`` will append the ``--prune``\ option to ``git fetch`` and
   thus removing any remote tracking branches which no longer exist on
   the remote (see `git fetch
   --help <http://linux.die.net/man/1/git-fetch>`__).

-  ``git-up.fetch.all [true|*false*]:`` If set to ``false``, ``PyGitUp``
   will only fetch remotes for which there is at least one local
   tracking branch. Setting this option will it ``git up`` always fetch
   from all remotes, which is useful if e.g. you use a remote to push to
   your CI system but never check those branches out.

-  ``git-up.rebase.arguments [string]:`` If set, ``PyGitUp`` will use
   this string as additional arguments when calling ``git rebase``.
   Example: ``--preserve-merges`` to recreate merge commits in the
   rebased branch.

-  ``git-up.rebase.auto [*true*|false]:`` If set to ``false``,
   ``PyGitUp`` won't rebase your branches for you but notify you that
   they diverged. This can be useful if you have a lot of in-progress
   work that you don't want to deal with at once, but still want to
   update other branches.

-  ``git-up.rebase.log-hook [cmd]:`` Runs ``cmd``\ every time a branch
   is rebased or fast-forwarder, with the old head as ``$1`` and the new
   head as ``$2``. This can be used to view logs or diffs of incoming
   changes. Example:
   '``echo "changes on $1:"; git log --oneline --decorate $1..$2``\ '
