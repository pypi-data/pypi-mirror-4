Test quality of USB connection to weather station

   usage: python USBQualityTest.py [options]
   options are:
    -h | --help           display this help
    -v | --verbose        increase amount of reassuring messages
                          (repeat for even more messages e.g. -vvv)

The USB link to my weather station is not 100% reliable. The data read
from the station by the computer is occasionally corrupted, perhaps by
interference. I've been trying to solve this by putting ferrite beads
around the USB cable and relocating possible interference sources such
as external hard drives. All without any success so far.

This program tests the USB connection for errors by continuously
reading the entire weather station memory (except for those parts that
may be changing) looking for errors. Each 32-byte block is read twice,
and if the two readings differ a warning message is displayed. Also
displayed are the number of blocks read, and the number of errors
found.

I typically get one or two errors per hour, so the test needs to be
run for several hours to produce a useful measurement. Note that other
software that accesses the weather station (such as *Hourly* or
*LiveLog*) must not be run while the test is in progress.

If you run this test and get no errors at all, please let me know.
There is something good about your setup and I'd love to know what it
is!
