Description: ==============
        requests_proxy
        ==============
        
        A WSGI Proxy using `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        With pip::
        
          $ pip install requests_proxy
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Create a proxy::
        
          >>> from requests_proxy import Proxy
          >>> proxy = Proxy(application_url)
        
        Then use it. Here is an example with WebOb but you can use it like a classic WSGI application::
        
          >>> from webob import Request
          >>> req = Request.blank('/form.html')
          >>> resp = req.get_response(proxy)
          >>> print(resp.text)
          <html>...
          ...</html>
        
        The Proxy application accept some keyword arguments. Those arguments are passed to requests during the process.
        By default ``allow_redirects`` and ``verify`` are set to ``False`` but you can change the behavior::
        
          >>> proxy = Proxy(application_url, verify=True, allow_redirects=True, max_redirects=10)
        
        Cheers
