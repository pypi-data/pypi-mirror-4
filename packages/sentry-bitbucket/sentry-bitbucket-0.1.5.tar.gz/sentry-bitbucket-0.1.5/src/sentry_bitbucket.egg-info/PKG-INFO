        An extension for Sentry which integrates with Bitbucket. Specifically, it allows you to easily create issues from events within Sentry.
        
        This is largely a port of the ``sentry-github`` package, the main difference being that it makes use of the ``requests`` library for communication with Bitbucket and implements OAuth, which is the preferred way to integrate with their API.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install the package via ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install sentry-bitbucket
        
        Ensure you've configured Bitbucket auth in Sentry by adding the following to your ``sentry.conf.py``::
        
            # Bitbucket needs to be included as a valid auth provider
            SENTRY_AUTH_PROVIDERS = {
                'twitter': ('TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY', 'TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET'),
                'facebook': ('FACEBOOK_APP_ID', 'FACEBOOK_API_SECRET'),
                'github': ('GITHUB_APP_ID', 'GITHUB_API_SECRET'),
                'google': ('GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID', 'GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET'),
                'trello': ('TRELLO_API_KEY', 'TRELLO_API_SECRET'),
                'bitbucket': ('BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_KEY', 'BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_SECRET'),
            }
        
            # https://bitbucket.org/account/user/<username>/api
            BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_KEY = ''
            BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_SECRET = ''
        
        Associate your account with Bitbucket (if you haven't already) via Account -> Identities.
        
        You'll now see a new action on groups which allows quick creation of Bitbucket issues.
        
        Caveats
        =======
        
        If you have multiple Bitbucket identities associated in Sentry, the plugin will just select
        one to use.
