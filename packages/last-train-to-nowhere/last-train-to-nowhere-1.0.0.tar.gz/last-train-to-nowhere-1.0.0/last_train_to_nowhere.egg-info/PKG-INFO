        You are an outlaw on the run - and you need to get the hell out of town.
        
        There's only one problem: the train has already left. Ok, two problems: it is
        also packed with law men.
        
        Only one thing to do: load your six-shooter, saddle up, and chase that train
        down!
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        If you haven't already please install the following dependencies::
        
            Python 2.7                  (required)
            Pyglet 1.1.4 or v1.2alpha1  (required)
            AVBin                       (recommended) for playing music
        
        
        Running the game
        ----------------
        
        Open a terminal window, "cd" into the game directory and run::
        
            python run_game.py
        
        
        How to play
        -----------
        
        The following input keys are used for this game::
        
            LEFT        move left
            RIGHT       move right
            UP          jump
            DOWN        crouch
            X           shoot from a distance or punch at close range
        
        The aim of the game is to progress forward in the train, and collecting all the
        gold bars on the train. The gold bars will be picked up as you touch them.
        
        But many lawmen are present, guarding the train and the gold. How can you get
        past them?
