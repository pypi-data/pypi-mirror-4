        *****************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `joyride`_ for `fanstatic`_, a library to provide a 
        feature tour on a website.
        
        Currently it packages an unreleased version of a fork_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`joyride`: https://github.com/zurb/joyride
        .. _`fork`: https://github.com/majido/joyride
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_joyride``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``XXX`` from ``js.jquery_joyride`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_joyride import joyride
          >>> joyride.need()
