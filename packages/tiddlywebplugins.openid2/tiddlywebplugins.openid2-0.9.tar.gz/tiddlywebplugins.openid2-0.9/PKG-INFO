Description: This is an OpenID challenger for TiddlyWeb that replaces the one that
        was originally included in the core TiddlyWeb package. It improves on
        that one by using the python-openid package, thus supporting OpenID 2
        and improved discovery mechanisms.
        
        To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.openid2' to auth_systems via 
        tiddlywebconfig.py. The following example replaces all existing
        auth_systems with just openid.
        
        config = {
            'auth_systems': ['tiddlywebplugins.openid2'],
        }
        
Platform: Posix; MacOS X; Windows
