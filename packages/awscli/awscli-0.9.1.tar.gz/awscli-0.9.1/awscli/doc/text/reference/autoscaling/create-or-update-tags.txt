create-or-update-tags
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates new tags or updates existing tags for an Auto Scaling group.

Note: A tag's definition is composed of a resource ID, resource type, key
  and value, and the propagate flag. Value and the propagate flag are
  optional parameters. See the Request Parameters for more
  information.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws autoscaling create-or-update-tags
     --tags <value>


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--tags"  (list)
   The tag to be created or updated. Each tag should be defined by its
   resource type, resource ID, key, value, and a propagate flag. The
   resource type and resource ID identify the type and name of
   resource for which the tag is created. Currently, "auto-scaling-
   group" is the only supported resource type. The valid value for the
   resource ID is *groupname* .

   The "PropagateAtLaunch" flag defines whether the new tag will be
   applied to instances launched by the Auto Scaling group. Valid
   values are "true" or "false" . However, instances that are already
   running will not get the new or updated tag. Likewise, when you
   modify a tag, the updated version will be applied only to new
   instances launched by the Auto Scaling group after the change.
   Running instances that had the previous version of the tag will
   continue to have the older tag.

   When you create a tag and a tag of the same name already exists,
   the operation overwrites the previous tag definition, but you will
   not get an error message.

      (structure)
         The tag applied to an Auto Scaling group.

         "resource_type"  (string)
            The kind of resource to which the tag is applied.
            Currently, Auto Scaling supports the "auto-scaling-group"
            resource type.

         "resource_id"  (string)
            The name of the Auto Scaling group.

         "propagate_at_launch"  (boolean)
            Specifies whether the new tag will be applied to instances
            launched after the tag is created. The same behavior
            applies to updates: If you change a tag, the changed tag
            will be applied to all instances launched after you made
            the change.

         "value"  (string)
            The value of the tag.

         "key"  (string)
            The key of the tag.
