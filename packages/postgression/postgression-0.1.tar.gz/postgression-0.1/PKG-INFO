Description: # python-postgression
        
        A python client for the postgression API.
        
        
        ## What is This?
        
        This is a simple CLI app that talks to the
        [postgression](http://www.postgression.com/) public API, and generates a
        temporary PostgreSQL database for usage in your test code (or just general
        messing around).
        
        postgression databases are automatically deleted after 30 minutes. No
        information is logged by the service.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install ``postgression`` using
        [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/):
        
        ``` bash
        $ pip install postgression
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once you've got ``postgression`` installed, you can generate a new PostgreSQL
        database by running ``postgression``... like so:
        
        ``` bash
        $ postgression
        postgres://user:password@host:port/db
        ```
        
        Each time you run ``postgression``, you'll get a new PostgreSQL database
        provisioned for usage.
        
        If for some reason a database can't be provisioned, an error will be returned.
