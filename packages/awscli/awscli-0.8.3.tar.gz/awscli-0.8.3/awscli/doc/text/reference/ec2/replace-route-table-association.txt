DESCRIPTION
===========

Changes the route table associated with a given subnet in a VPC. After
you execute this action, the subnet uses the routes in the new route
table it's associated with. For more information about route tables,
go to Route Tables in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.

You can also use this to change which table is the main route table in
the VPC. You just specify the main route table's association ID and
the route table that you want to be the new main route table.
