"""
The backup script for the system.

It accepts a ``project`` name and an ``output_path`` which is the output of 
the filtered files.

The system creates filter rules to be used with ``rsync`` command and then calls
the ``rsync`` command on the server.

Because the pipeline ends at a Nuke file, all the source files which needs to
be backed up are listed in this nuke (*.nk) file. So the script searches for the
latest versions of nuke files, and if a ``-nv n`` parameters is also passed, 
then the last ``n`` versions will be investigated for source files.

Script will search for, Read, ReadGeo, ReadGeo2, Write, WriteGeo nodes and will
use the path value listed in the ``file`` attribute of those nodes.

If the file path is relative and a project_dir is present in the nuke file 
than the path will be converted to an absolute path.

:arg --project, -p: The name of the project. It should match the exact project 
  name otherwise it will raise a ValueError.

:arg --extra_filter_rules, -ef: a file which is holding extra filter rules 
  Can be skipped.

:arg --number_of_versions, -nv: the number of versions to be used in backup 
  process. Default value is 1.

:arg --output, -o: the output of the backed up files.

Examples::
  
  backup -p ProjectName -o /mnt/M/JOBs_Backup
  # creates a backup_filter file in the path that the script is executed
  
  # No output will raise RuntimeError:
  backup -p ProjectName
  # raises RuntimeError

"""

# TODO: add ability to backup individual sequences
#:arg --sequence, -s: The name of the sequence. It should match the exact 
#  sequence name, and if skipped, all the sequences under the given project 
#  will be filtered and backed up.
