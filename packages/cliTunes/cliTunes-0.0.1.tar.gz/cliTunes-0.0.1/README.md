cliTunes
=========

For now, this is just a command-line interface to iTunes. It's pretty
simple, but I am considering making it do a lot of more interesting
things as time goes by.

It's not in pip, because working with PyPi is a horrible experience that
I will worry about some other time.

Usage
-----

Put bin/clitunes somewhere in your path. Now, you can do things like this:

    clitunes play
    clitunes pause
    clitunes stop
