This package provides a functional test setup based on a WSGI server which is 
able to start your WSGI application. And offers a headless WebKit browser
which is able to process JavaScript and all the fancy Ajax calls. This package
can get used for all kind of python WSGI applications and not only for zope
applications. The WebKit browser depends PySide and lxml but (should) get
transparently installed with this package.
