Description: Django ViewClass Mixins
        =======================
        
        Provides some common mixin patterns for Django's View classes.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Run `pip install django-viewclass-mixins`
        
        View Mixins
        -----------
        
        ###LoginMixin
        Ensures the view is being requested by an authenticated user or redirects to the login page. It behaves the same as the function decorator `login_required`.
        
        ###ObjectOwnerMixin
        A mixin to single-object views. Ensures the view is by requested by the owner of the requested object.
        
        ###DeactivateMixin
        A mixin to the DeleteView. Instead of deleting an object it will mark it as inactive instead.
        
        ###FilterListMixin
        A mixin to the ListView. It will apply filters from the URL querystring to the underlying QuerySet before the list is returned.
