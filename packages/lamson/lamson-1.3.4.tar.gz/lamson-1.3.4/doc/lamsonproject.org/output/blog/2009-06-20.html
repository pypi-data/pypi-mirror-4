            <div id="main_content">
                <h1>Lamson 0.9.4 With Unicode Super Powers</h1>
                	<p>Lamson 0.9.4 is out and it&#8217;s sporting a completely rewritten and meticulously 
crafted encoding system.  With the new <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.encoding-module.html">lamson.encoding</a> code Lamson can now decode nearly any nasty horrible encoded spam
or mail you hand it, turn it into pristine nice Python unicode strings, and
then output sweet clean ascii or utf-8 in a consistent way.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this new encoding system is to make sure that Lamson
is giving your handlers the best input it can, based on the assumption
that the world is evil and Lamson will be handed utter garbage.</p>

	<p>In order to pull this off, Lamson actually attempts to decode everything
it gets, and uses <a href="http://chardet.feedparser.org/">chardet</a> to guess whenever
it can&#8217;t.  It goes far enough to make sure that 99.9% of legit mail gets through,
and the rest is usually spam.  However, Lamson is so good at this conversion
now that it even does it properly on about 99% of spam, even more.</p>

	<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter what character encoding is used, if there&#8217;s a mix of encodings
or even if something lies about the encoding or doesn&#8217;t give one.  Lamson can
figure this out and convert it anyway, and the rest is junk.</p>

	<p>You can look at this <a href="/lamson_vs_spam.png">image of a spam inbox</a> and 
<a href="/lamson_vs_spam_2.png">this image of a spam inbox</a> where you can see a
screen session showing this off.  This is a split screen with a Mutt on top
showing badly formatted spam, and then a Mutt on the bottom with the
results of Lamson&#8217;s cleansing.  This is just running in iTerm, but looks
the same in most unicode enabled terminals and clients.</p>

	<p>The interesting side effect of Lamson&#8217;s decoding is that it undoes almost all 
of the spam obfuscation techniques quickly and consistently.</p>

	<h2>There Will Be Bugs</h2>

	<p>I&#8217;ve thrashed the hell out of this code and made sure that I really took
the time to get it right.  I&#8217;ve ran it on thousands and thousands of real and
spam mail and tested the crap out of it with unit tests and fuzzing.</p>

	<p>Still, this is new code handling email so there will be bugs in it.  If
you run into an email that you think should parse correctly, send it to
me and I&#8217;ll look at it.</p>

	<h2>How It Works</h2>

	<p>All Lamson does is completely parse every header and figure out how to decode it,
but it assumes that the client is a liar.  If the string decodes without errors
then Lamson is happy, but if it blows up then Lamson uses chardet to figure out
what the contents really are encoded as.  If chardet can&#8217;t figure it out, or if
it&#8217;s still busted, then Lamson rejects that mail (which happens less than a fraction
of a percent of the time to real email).</p>

	<p>Once this decoding process is finished Lamson has converted the email completely
into Python unicode only.  You can work with it in a modern way without worrying
about the original codecs, and you can set your headers and attachments without
worrying about setting the codecs because Lamson will use the same tech to get
the encoding right.</p>

	<p>When Lamson writes an email, it assumes that your text can be encoded as either
plain <span class="caps">ASCII</span> (as most headers are), or UTF-8.  If it can&#8217;t, then your text 
probably can&#8217;t be processed by Lamson anyway.  Lamson will favor <span class="caps">ASCII</span> first since
it&#8217;s easier, and then use UTF-8 for anything that can&#8217;t be <span class="caps">ASCII</span>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>During this conversion process anything that&#8217;s <strong>not</strong> text is treated as raw binary
and just decoded as-is.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>By doing this Lamson produces nice clean email that can be easily processed and
passed around, and which you can review and debug easier.  It also turns Lamson
into a &#8220;modernizing&#8221; agent since it is producing the email it wants to see.</p>

	<h2>Getting This Release</h2>

	<p>I had some issues pushing this release to PyPI, so let me know if it barfs on you.</p>

	<p>Otherwise, you can hit the <a href="/download.html">download</a> section and grab the 
gear.</p>

	<h2>The New &#8220;Cleanse&#8221; Command</h2>

	<p>In order to make it easier for people to try this new cleansing system on real
email I&#8217;ve written a quick <code>lamson cleanse</code> command.  What this command will do is
take a mbox or Maildir, and run it through the washing machine, writing the results
to a different maildir.  When it&#8217;s done you can go look at the reasons why some
mail failed, how many failures, and you can actually open that maildir mail and
look at it with your client.</p>

	<p>Try it out and report any errors you find.</p>
