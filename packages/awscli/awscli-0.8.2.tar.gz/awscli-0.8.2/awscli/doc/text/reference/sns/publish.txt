publish
*******


DESCRIPTION
===========

The publish action sends a message to all of a topic's subscribed
endpoints. When a messageId is returned, the message has been saved
and Amazon SNS will attempt to deliver it to the topic's subscribers
shortly. The format of the outgoing message to each subscribed
endpoint depends on the notification protocol selected.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws sns publish
     --message <value>
     --topic-arn <value>
     [--message-structure <value>]
     [--subject <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--message"  (string)
   The message you want to send to the topic.

   Constraints: Messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings at most 8 KB in
   size (8192 bytes, not 8192 characters).

"--topic-arn"  (string)
   The topic you want to publish to.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--message-structure"  (string)
   Optional parameter. It will have one valid value: "json". If this
   option, --message is present and set to "json", the value of
   --message must: be a syntactically valid JSON object. It must
   contain at least a top level JSON key of "default" with a value
   that is a string. For any other top level key that matches one of
   our transport protocols (e.g. "http"), then the corresponding value
   (if it is a string) will be used for the message published for that
   protocol

   Constraints: Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported
   transport protocols must have simple JSON string values. The values
   will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing
   messages. Typically, outbound notifications are JSON encoded
   (meaning, the characters will be reescaped for sending). JSON
   strings are UTF-8. Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty
   string, "", is allowed). Values have a maximum length bounded by
   the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may
   limit message sizes). Non-string values will cause the key to be
   ignored. Keys that do not correspond to supported transport
   protocols will be ignored. Duplicate keys are not allowed. Failure
   to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the
   publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).

"--subject"  (string)
   Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line of when the
   message is delivered to e-mail endpoints. This field will also be
   included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to
   other endpoints.

   Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter,
   number or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control
   characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.
