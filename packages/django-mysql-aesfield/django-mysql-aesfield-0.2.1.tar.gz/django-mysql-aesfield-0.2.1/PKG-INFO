Description: AES Field
        =============
        
        Provides an AES field for Django that works with MySQL to do the AES encryption
        and decryption in the database.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Like any other field::
        
            from aesfield.field import AESField
        
            class SomeModel(...):
                key = AESField()
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        AESField takes the following parameters beyond a normal CharField:
        
        * `aes_prefix`: the prefix to use on fields, defaults to `aes:`
        
        * `aes_key`: the key to use in the lookup method to find a suitable key for
          this field, defaults to `default`
        
        Settings:
        
        * `AES_METHOD`: the module to look in for a key lookup method, if you want
          something different from the default, `aesfield.default`
        
        * `AES_KEYS`: used by the `aesfield.default` method. It's a dictionary of keys
          to filenames. Those files must be able to be read by the Django process. It
          must have a `default` key, unless you specify a specifc one in `aes_key`
        
        Commands
        --------
        
        If you add `aesfield` to `INSTALLED_APPS` you'll get one more command,
        `generate_aes_keys`. This will generate a new file for each file mentioned in
        the `AES_KEYS` dictionary. *But only if that file does not already exist*.
