PyNeb (Luridiana V. & Morisset C., 2012) is a modern python tool to compute emission line emissivities (recombination and collisionaly excited lines).

Emission line ratios are used to self consistently determine physical properties (electron temperature and density).
Diagnostic diagrams can easily be plotted (see Fig. 1).
Ionic abundances can be determined.
Various Ionization Correction Factors (ICFs) are available to obtain total elemental abundances from the ionic abundances.
Atomic data can easily be changed and upgraded
Additional tools are provided, like reddening determination and correction procedures.

Requirements
============

PyNeb uses numpy, matplotlib, pyfits and other standard python libraries.

Installation
============

You may find useful to download, install and upgrade PyNeb using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
