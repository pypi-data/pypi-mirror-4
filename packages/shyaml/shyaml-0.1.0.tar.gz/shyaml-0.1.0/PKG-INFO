       |Disclaimer
       |==========
       |
       |This scripts was written very quickly and will not support all YAML
       |manipulation that you could have dreamed of. But it should support
       |some handy basic query of YAML file.
       |
       |Please take a look at the next section to get a quick overview of
       |``shyaml`` capabilities.
       |
       |
       |Description
       |===========
       |
       |Simple scripts that allow read access to YAML files through command line.
       |
       |This can be handy, if you want to get access to YAML data in your shell
       |scripts.
       |
       |
       |Usage
       |=====
       |
       |``shyaml`` takes it YAML input file from standard input ONLY. So there are
       |some sample routine.
       |
       |Let's create a sample yaml file::
       |
       |    $ cat <<EOF > test.yaml
       |    name: "MyName !!"
       |    subvalue:
       |        how-much: 1.1
       |        how-many: 2
       |        things:
       |            - first
       |            - second
       |            - third

       |            Multiline description:
       |            Line 1
       |            Line 2
       |    EOF
       |
       |Simple query of simple attribute::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value name
       |    MyName !!
       |
       |Query nested attributes::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.how-much
       |    1.1
       |
       |Get type of attributes::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-type name
       |    str
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue.how-much
       |    float
       |
       |Get sub YAML from a structure attribute::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-type subvalue
       |    struct
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue
       |    description: 'Multiline description:
       |
       |      Line 1
       |
       |      Line 2
       |
       |      '
       |    how-many: 2
       |    how-much: 1.1

       |    - first
       |    - second
       |    - third
       |
       |Useless fun::
       |
       |    $ cat test.yaml | shyaml get-value subvalue | shyaml get-value things
       |    - first
       |    - second
       |    - third
       |
       |A Quick remainder of what is available::
       |
       |    $ shyaml
       |    usage:
       |        shyaml get-value KEY
       |        shyaml get-type KEY
       |        shyaml keys
