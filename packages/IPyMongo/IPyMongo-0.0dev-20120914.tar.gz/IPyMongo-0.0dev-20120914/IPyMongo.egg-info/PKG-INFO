Description: This module installs the ipymongo script and IPython
        extension, which allows you to use the following new magic commands in IPython:
        
         - use <database>
         - connect [ <mongodb uri> ]
         - login [ <username> <password> ]
        
        You also get access to the following global variables:
        
         - db (current database)
         - conn (current mongodb connection)
        
        Your prompt is also updated to show the current database name.
        
        The ipymongo command takes an optional mongodb:// uri. If not supplied, it will
        connect to mongodb://localhost:27017/test.
