How to use?
-----------

You can import ``fineuploader`` from ``js.fineuploader`` and ``need`` it where
you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.fineuploader import fineuploader
  >>> fineuploader.need()

Or if you want the jQuery plugin version::

  >>> from js.fineuploader import jquery_fineuploader
  >>> jquery_fineuploader.need()

With either version you might also want the CSS::

  >>> from js.fineuploader import fineuploader_css
  >>> fineuploader_css.need()
