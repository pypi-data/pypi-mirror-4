emcee is a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant
ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
proposed by
`Goodman & Weare (2010) <http://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/papers/d13.pdf>`_.
The code is open source and has
already been used in several published projects in the Astrophysics
literature.
