Description: ========================
        Django visitor
        ========================
        
        This is a fairly simple visitor tracking application for Django,
        designed to make allowing tracking visitors as painless as possible. It
        requires a functional installation of Django 1.1 or newer, but has no
        other dependencies.
        
        For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this
        directory;
        
        
        ==========
        Change Log
        ==========
        0.1.7 - Fixed an issue with visitor_utils.get_visitor_from_request() that was causing an error with missing get_visitor()
        
        0.1.6 - Fixed the pypi tar.gz, it was missing some files
        
        0.1.5 - Added VISITOR_IGNORE_IP_LIST custom setting to help with issues behind a load balancer.
        
        0.1.4 - Merged in changes from pydanny (cleanup and better docs)
        
        0.1.3 - Added missing constant "REQUEST_LOG_ID" used by other applications.
        
        0.1.2 - Added support for akamai's site accelerator, it puts the visitors origin IP in a custom header, so I needed to add a change to support this.
