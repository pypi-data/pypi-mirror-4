    """The returned ``httpserver`` provides a threaded HTTP server instance
    running on a randomly assigned port on localhost. It can be taught which
    content (i.e. string) to serve with which response code and comes with
    following attributes:

    * ``code`` - HTTP response code (int)
    * ``content`` - content of next response (str)
    * ``headers`` - response headers (dict)

    Once these attribute are set, all subsequent requests will be answered with
    these values until they are changed or the server is stopped. A more
    convenient way to change these is ::

        httpserver.serve_content(content=None, code=200, headers=None) 

    The server address can be found in property
                                            
    * ``url``
                                                
    which is the string representation of tuple ``server_address`` (host as
    str, port as int).
