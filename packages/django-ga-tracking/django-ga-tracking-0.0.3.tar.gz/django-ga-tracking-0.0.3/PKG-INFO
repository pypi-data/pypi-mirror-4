Description: ==================
        django-ga-tracking
        ==================
        
        django-ga-tracking is a simple Django pluggable app that provides a context
        processor and template for adding `Google Analytics`_ tracking code to your
        pages.
        
        Alternatives and differences
        ============================
        
        There are alternatives like `django-google-analytics`_ and `Django Analytics
        Middleware`_, but this project begun as both solutions seem to introduce
        unnecessary complexity and/or lack the ability to configure analytics via
        Django settings module. The latter factor was particularly important for this
        project because hard-coding configuration or storing configuration in a
        databaes column was something we absolutely wanted to avoid.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install using pip::
        
            pip install django-ga-tracking
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        Add ``ga_tracking`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        Next, add the ``ga_tracking_id`` context processor to
        ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``::
        
            TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
                ....
                'ga_tracking.context_processors.ga_tracking_id',
            )
        
        Define a ``GA_TRACKING_ID`` setting and assign your tracking ID to it.  For
        example::
        
            GA_TRACKING_ID = 'UA-12345678-9'
        
        Finally, add the tracker code template somewhere in your own template::
        
            {% include "ga_tracking/ga.html" %}
        
        New tracking code
        =================
        
        Google Analytics offers an alternative tracking code (``analytics.js``). This
        code is also available in django-ga-tracking. Since the tracking code uses both
        the property ID and the top level domain, you will need to specify both. So,
        add this to your settings::
        
            GA_TRACKING_ID = 'UA-12345678-9'
            GA_DOMAIN = 'example.com'
        
        Next, include the alternative template::
        
            {% include "ga_tracking/ga_new.html" %}
        
        Customization
        =============
        
        Because django-ga-tracking uses a simple template to add the code, you can
        customize it simply by overriding the template with your own. The ``ga.html``
        template contains the default ``<script>`` block as provided by Google. 
        
        The script block is *not* rendered at all if the ``GA_TRACKING_ID`` setting is
        not present, so you can, for example, set the setting only in production to
        avoid development sites from being tracked, or use different tracking codes on
        different deployments. For example::
        
            # in settings.py
            import os
        
            GA_TRACKING_ID = os.environ.get('GA_TRACKING_ID')
