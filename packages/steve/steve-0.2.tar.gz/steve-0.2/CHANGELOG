version 0.2 -- March 17th, 2013
===============================

**API Changes**

* **changed steve.util.verify_json to steve.util.verify_video_data**

  The previous function name was a misnomer---it takes a Python
  dict as an argument and has nothing to do with JSON.


**Other Changes**

* **added steve.restapi**

  Basic REST client to talk to richard instances.

* **added steve.richardapi**

  Added the richardapi module which has some functions that make
  it easier to do richard API things

* **added steve.util.html_to_markdown**

  Since richard and pyvideo now use Markdown for summaries and
  descriptions, it helps to have a converter.

* **added webedit command of awesome**

  steve now has a webedit command that lets you edit JSON files
  in a web-based editor.


version 0.1 -- January 13th, 2013
=================================

* **First version, so everything is new.**

  See documentation for features and how to use it!
