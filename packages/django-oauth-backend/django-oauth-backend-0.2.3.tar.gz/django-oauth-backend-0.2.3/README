Django OAuth Backend
====================

`Django OAuth Backend`_ is a set of Django_ models which are required
for implementing OAuth_ protocol on the server side. Those models can
be used together with various other projects which implement HTTP part
of the protocol. One such projects is `lazr.authentication`_.


Usage
-----

Usage is quite simple.

First thing is to add this application to Django's ``INSTALLED_APPS``
list::

      INSTALLED_APPS = (
          ...
          'oauth_backend'
      )

Next is to integrate it with OAuth_ protocol provider, like
`lazr.authentication`_. It will look something like that::

     # Application's WSGI file
     from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler
     from lazr.authentication.wsgi import OAuthMiddleware
     from oauth_backend.models import DataStore, Consumer, Token


     def oauth_authenticate(oauth_consumer, oauth_token, parameters):
         try:
             consumer = Consumer.objects.get(
                 user__username=oauth_consumer.key
             )
             token = Token.objects.get(token=oauth_token.key)
             if token.consumer.key == oauth_consumer.key:
                 return consumer.user
         except (Token.DoesNotExist, Consumer.DoesNotExist):
             return None

     
     django = WSGIHandler()
     application = OAuthMiddleware(
         django, 
         authenticate_with=oauth_authenticate,
         data_store=DataStore(),
         protect_path_pattern="/protected"
     )


.. note:: Where ``oauth_authenticate`` is function which checks that
          OAuth_ token is known. Additionally you can check that user
          associated with this token is allowed to use it, or that
          token itself is not expired. Because that part is highly
          dependant on the mechanisms of application itself it's not
          provided out of the box.


History
-------

This code was extracted from `Canonical Identity Provider`_
project. Although an extra effort was made to make sure that all
dependencies are broken and this code is fully independent, it's
conceivable that some small things were missed. In that case please
report those bugs on the `project's bug page`_.
