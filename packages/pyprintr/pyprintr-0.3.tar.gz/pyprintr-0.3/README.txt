Python-printr for own objects of a class instance
Python-printr is a module that allows to emulate the print_r() function of PHP 
by printing the objects properties of a class instance and its internal 
structure. If you need to use printr() function for list, tuples and dicts, 
please, don't use printr() function. You can choose pprint module. printr() 
function is only for objects of your own class instances.
