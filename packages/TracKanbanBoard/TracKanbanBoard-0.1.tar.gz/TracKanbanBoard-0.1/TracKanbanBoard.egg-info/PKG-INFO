        Installation
        ============
        
        #. Clone the repository::
        
            git clone https://projects.developer.nokia.com/git/TracKanbanBoard.git trackanbanboard
        
        #. Run setup script::
        
            cd trackanbanboard
            python setup.py install
        
        #. Enable component in Trac configuration::
        
            [components]
            trackanbanboard.* = enabled
        
        #. Create/modify wiki page and put `KanbanBoard` processor in it. Empty data will give an error but also the detailed usage instructions::
        
            This is wiki text:
            {{{
            #!KanbanBoard
            }}}
        
        Data storage
        ============
        
        Plugin uses Trac tickets as kanban board "cards". Any existing ticket from project can be added to the board and modifed either from board or from default Trac ticket view.
        
        Board configuration and state is stored on wiki page inside `KanbanBoard` processor block in JSON format (see example below). When cards are moved around, plugin updates the state and rewrites the wiki page.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Here's an example macro definition that produces Kanban board with three columns (New, Ongoing and Done) and shows status and priority fields in ticket dialog. First column contains three tickets (in order from top to bottom: #23, #24 and #25), second column one ticket and third column is empty. Invalid ticket IDs in configuration are ignored and removed automatically when board state is saved. ::
        
            {{{
            #!KanbanBoard height=250px
            {
              "columns": [
                { "id": 1, "name": "New", "states": ["new"], "tickets": [23, 24, 25], "wip": 3 },
                { "id": 2, "name": "Ongoing", "states": ["assigned", "accepted", "reopened"], "tickets": [21], "wip": 3 },
                { "id": 3, "name": "Done", "states": ["closed"], "tickets": [], "wip": 5 }
              ],
              "fields": [
                "status", "priority"
              ]
            }
            }}}
        
        Description for different options and properties can be displayed with `[[MacroList(KanbanBoard)]]` macro.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        Tickets can be added to board by drag-and-dropping ticket links to board. Links can be dragged from same page as board, separate browser window or from the ticket query dialog which can be opened by clicking the 'Add tickets' button.
        
        New ticket can be created by clicking the 'New ticket' button and entering ticket details. Tickets created this way are added to board automatically.
        
        Each "card" on board displays ticket ID and summary. Additional details can be viewed in ticket detail dialog which can be opened by clicking individual cards. Detail dialog contains:
        
        - Link to corresponding Trac ticket page (in title bar)
        - Ticket creation and modification times
        - Summary
        - Any user defined fields (as defined by "fields" property in macro definition)
        - Ticket description as plain text
        - Change history
        - Comment field
        
        If user has TICKET_MODIFY and WIKI_MODIFY permissions, summary, description, custom fields and comment are editable and changes can be saved by clicking 'Save' button.
        
        Tickets can be removed from board by clicking 'Remove from board' button in ticket detail dialog. Removing ticket from board does not modify or delete the ticket.
        
        If user has proper permissions ticket status can also be modified by dragging tickets from one column to another. In this case ticket's new status is the first status of destination column's "states" property.
