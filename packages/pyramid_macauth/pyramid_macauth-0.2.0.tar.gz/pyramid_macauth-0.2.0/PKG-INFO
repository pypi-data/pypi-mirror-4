        ===============
        
        This is a Pyramid authenitcation plugin for MAC Access Authentication:
        
            http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-http-mac-01
        
        To access resources using MAC Access Authentication, the client must have
        obtained a set of MAC credentials including an id and secret key.  They use
        these credentials to make signed requests to the server.
        
        When accessing a protected resource, the server will generate a 401 challenge
        response with the scheme "MAC" as follows::
        
            > GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
            > Host: example.com
        
            < HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
            < WWW-Authenticate: MAC
        
        The client will use their MAC credentials to build a request signature and
        include it in the Authorization header like so::
        
            > GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
            > Host: example.com
            > Authorization: MAC id="h480djs93hd8",
            >                    ts="1336363200",
            >                    nonce="dj83hs9s",
            >                    mac="bhCQXTVyfj5cmA9uKkPFx1zeOXM="
        
            < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
            < Content-Type: text/plain
            <
            < For your eyes only:  secret data!
        
        
        This plugin uses the tokenlib library for verifying MAC credentials:
        
            https://github.com/mozilla-services/tokenlib
        
        If this library does not meet your needs, you can provide a custom callback
        function to decode the MAC id token.
