Description: Description
        ===========
        
        The buildout syseggrecipe uses system installed eggs, 
        called syseggs.
        These syseggs are used instead of installing them again during buildout.
        This is usefull for hard to compile eggs or eggs that need specific 
        development libraries.
        
        Example
        ========
        
        An example of how to use the recipe. Please note that the sysegg recipe
        must be the first buildout part.::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = sysegg
          
          [sysegg]
          recipe = syseggrecipe
          eggs =
            netCDF4
        
        To stop the buildout when not all syseggs are installed include: 
        `force-sysegg = True`.::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = sysegg
        
          [sysegg]
          recipe = syseggrecipe
          force-sysegg = true
          eggs =
            netCDF4
        
        Tests
        ======
        
        To test if all syseggs are available while `force-sysegg = true` is 
        enabled in the buildout configuration.:: 
        
          bin/buildout sysegg:force-sysegg=false sysegg
