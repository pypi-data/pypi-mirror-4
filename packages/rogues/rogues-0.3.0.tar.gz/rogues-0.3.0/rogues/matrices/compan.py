    COMPAN  Companion matrix.
        compan(p) is a companion matrix.  There are three cases.
        If p is a scalar then compan(p) is the p-by-p matrix compan(1:p+1).
        If p is an (n+1)-vector, compan(p) is the n-by-n companion matrix
           whose first row is -p(2:n+1)/p(1).
        If p is a square matrix, compan(p) is the companion matrix
           of the characteristic polynomial of p, computed as
           compan(poly(p)).
