        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add ``bda.disclaimer`` to installation dependencies and and install product.
        
        
        Provide the Disclaimer Text
        ---------------------------
        
        Disclaimer text is looked up via ``bda.disclaimer.interfaces.IDisclaimerText``
        adapter. The default implementation expects an document at Plone Site root with
        Id ``disclaimer``. The Body Text of this Document is used as disclaimer
        text.
