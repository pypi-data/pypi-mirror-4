register-instances-with-load-balancer
*************************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Adds new instances to the LoadBalancer.

Once the instance is registered, it starts receiving traffic and
requests from the LoadBalancer. Any instance that is not in any of the
Availability Zones registered for the LoadBalancer will be moved to
the *OutOfService* state. It will move to the *InService* state when
the Availability Zone is added to the LoadBalancer.

Note: In order for this call to be successful, the client must have
  created the LoadBalancer. The client must provide the same account
  credentials as those that were used to create the LoadBalancer.

Note: Completion of this API does not guarantee that operation has
  completed. Rather, it means that the request has been registered and
  the changes will happen shortly.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws elb register-instances-with-load-balancer
     --instances <value>
     --load-balancer-name <value>


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--instances"  (list)
   A list of instance IDs that should be registered with the
   LoadBalancer.

      Note: When the instance is stopped and then restarted, the IP
        addresses associated with your instance changes. Elastic Load
        Balancing cannot recognize the new IP address, which prevents
        it from routing traffic to your instances. We recommend that
        you de-register your Amazon EC2 instances from your load
        balancer after you stop your instance, and then register the
        load balancer with your instance after you've restarted. To
        de-register your instances from load balancer, use
        deregister-instances-from-load-balancer action.

     (structure)
        The Instance data type.

        "instance_id"  (string)
           Provides an EC2 instance ID.

"--load-balancer-name"  (string)
   The name associated with the LoadBalancer. The name must be unique
