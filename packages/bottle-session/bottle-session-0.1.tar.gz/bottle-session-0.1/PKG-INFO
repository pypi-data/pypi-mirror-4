Description: 
        Bottle_session is a session manager for the Bottle microframework that uses a
        cookie to maintain your web session and stores a hash associated with that
        cookie using the redis key-value store. It is designed as a simple Bottle
        plugin.
        
        Examples and additional documentation are available in the README and
