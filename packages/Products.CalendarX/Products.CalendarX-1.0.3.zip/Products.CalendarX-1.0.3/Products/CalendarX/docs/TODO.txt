ToDo list as seen at launch for CalendarX 0.9.5(stable)
=======================================================

1. rout the mouseover display bugs.  there are several where the calendar cells
   are not properly highlighted when you mouseover an event, especially events
   that span two days or two months or differences between the regular events
   and the ones in the "continuing" listing on weekbyhour and multimonth views.
   non-critical (exist in 0.6.6 too) but frustrating.
2. test everything else too
3. document how to do everything in Plone 3
4. get recurring events working (via vs.event)
