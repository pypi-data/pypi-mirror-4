.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Records a \fBWorkflowExecutionTerminated\fP event and forces closure of the
workflow execution identified by the given domain, runId, and workflowId. The
child policy, registered with the workflow type or specified when starting this
execution, is applied to any open child workflow executions of this workflow
execution.
.IP Warning
If the identified workflow execution was in progress, it is terminated
immediately.
.RE
.IP Note
If a \-\-run\-id is not specified, then the \fBWorkflowExecutionTerminated\fP event
is recorded in the history of the current open workflow with the matching
\-\-workflow\-id in the domain.
.RE
.IP Note
You should consider using  request\-cancel\-workflow\-execution action instead
because it allows the workflow to gracefully close while
terminate\-workflow\-execution does not.
.RE
.sp
\fBAccess Control\fP
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the \-\-domain name to limit the action to only
specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\(aqs parameters.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails by
throwing \fBOperationNotPermitted\fP . For \-\-details and example IAM policies, see
\fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-domain\fP  (string)
The \-\-domain of the workflow execution to terminate.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-workflow\-id\fP  (string)
The \-\-workflow\-id of the workflow execution to terminate.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-reason\fP  (string)
An optional descriptive \-\-reason for terminating the workflow execution.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-child\-policy\fP  (string)
If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of the
workflow execution being terminated. This policy overrides the child policy
specified for the workflow execution at registration time or when starting the
execution. The supported child policies are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTERMINATE:\fP the child executions will be terminated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBREQUEST_CANCEL:\fP a request to cancel will be attempted for each child
execution by recording a \fBWorkflowExecutionCancelRequested\fP event in its
history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it
receives an execution history with this event.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBABANDON:\fP no action will be taken. The child executions will continue to
run.
.UNINDENT
.IP Note
A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a
default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this
parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration
time, a fault will be returned.
.RE
.TP
.B \fB\-\-details\fP  (string)
Optional \-\-details for terminating the workflow execution.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-run\-id\fP  (string)
The \-\-run\-id of the workflow execution to terminate.
