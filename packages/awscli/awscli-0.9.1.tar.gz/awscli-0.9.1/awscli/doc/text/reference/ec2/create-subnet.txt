create-subnet
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a subnet in an existing VPC. You can create up to 20 subnets
in a VPC. If you add more than one subnet to a VPC, they're set up in
a star topology with a logical router in the middle. When you create
each subnet, you provide the VPC ID and the CIDR block you want for
the subnet. Once you create a subnet, you can't change its CIDR block.
The subnet's CIDR block can be the same as the VPC's CIDR block
(assuming you want only a single subnet in the VPC), or a subset of
the VPC's CIDR block. If you create more than one subnet in a VPC, the
subnets' CIDR blocks must not overlap. The smallest subnet (and VPC)
you can create uses a "/28" netmask (16 IP addresses), and the largest
uses a "/18" netmask (16,384 IP addresses).

Warning: AWS reserves both the first four and the last IP address in each
  subnet's CIDR block. They're not available for use.
