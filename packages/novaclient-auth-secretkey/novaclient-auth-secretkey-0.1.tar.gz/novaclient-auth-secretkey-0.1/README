novaclient-auth-secretkey
=========================


This is an authentication plugin for python-novaclient.  It allows
novaclient users to specify an API key+secret key as credentials to
the Keystone authentication service instead of the normal
username+password.

Plugin users can specify the credentials either programmatically as
attributes of the httpclient object, or using environment variables (e.g.
when using the command-line nova client).
