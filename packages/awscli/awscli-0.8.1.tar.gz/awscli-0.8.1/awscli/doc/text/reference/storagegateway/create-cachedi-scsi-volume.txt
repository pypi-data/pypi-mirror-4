create-cachedi-scsi-volume
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation creates a cached volume on a specified cached gateway.
This operation is supported only for the gateway-cached volume
architecture.

Note: Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create
  a cached volume. Use the  add-cache operation to add cache storage
  to a gateway.

In the request, you must specify the gateway, size of the volume in
bytes, the iSCSI target name, an IP address on which to expose the
target, and a unique client token. In response, AWS Storage Gateway
creates the volume and returns information about it such as the volume
Amazon Resource Name (ARN), its size, and the iSCSI target ARN that
initiators can use to connect to the volume target.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws storagegateway create-cachedi-scsi-volume
     --volume-size-in-bytes <value>
     --network-interface-id <value>
     --client-token <value>
     --gateway-arn <value>
     --target-name <value>
     [--snapshot-id <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--volume-size-in-bytes"  (long)
   The size of the cached volume.

"--network-interface-id"  (string)
   The network interface of the gateway on which to expose the iSCSI
   target. Only IPv4 addresses are accepted. Use the  describe-
   gateway-information operation to get a list of the network
   interfaces available on the gateway.

"--client-token"  (string)
   A unique identifying string for the cached volume.

"--gateway-arn"  (string)
   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  list-
   gateways operation to return a list of gateways for your account
   and region.

"--target-name"  (string)
   The name of the iSCSI target used by initiators to connect to the
   target and as a suffix for the target ARN. For example, specifying
   **--target-name** as *myvolume* results in the target ARN of
   *arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-1:1111
   22223333:gateway/mygateway/target/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume*
   . The target name must be unique across all volumes of a gateway.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--snapshot-id"  (string)
   The snapshot ID (e.g., "snap-1122aabb") of the snapshot to restore
   as the new stored volume. Specify this field if you want to create
   the iSCSI cached volume from a snapshot; otherwise, do not include
   this field. To list snapshots for your account, use
   *DescribeSnapshots <http://docs.amazonwebservi
   ces.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-
   DescribeSnapshots.html>* _ in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API
   Reference.
