= SeedWater Segmenter =

Seedwater Segmenter (SWS) is a graphical Python program to interactively segment image stacks of cells in tissue with edge-labels (aka. white outlines). The interactions are entirely based on the editing of seeds, which in turn are expanded by a watershed algorithm. The major difference between SWS and other tools is that you can place more than one seed per cell which can help you adjust the boundaries of difficult cells.

SWS is built on top of wxPython, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, and mahotas.

At its core, it uses a lightning-fast watershed algorithm (thanks to the mahotas project) and allows real-time updates. It has a simple (if cluttered) UI and is fully interactive, even including 1-level undo.

Source code is mirrored to four repositories and to PyPI:

  * GitHub:      http://github.com/davidmashburn/SeedWaterSegmenter/
  * Bitbucket:   http://bitbucket.org/davidmashburn/seedwatersegmenter
  * Gitorious:   http://gitorious.org/seedwatersegmenter
  * Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/seedwater/
  * PyPI:        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SeedWaterSegmenter


The Google Code page also has some binary releases (http://code.google.com/p/seedwater/) that should work on 32-bit Windows or 64-bit Linux, but these are now old. Please use the "easy_install" method now.
