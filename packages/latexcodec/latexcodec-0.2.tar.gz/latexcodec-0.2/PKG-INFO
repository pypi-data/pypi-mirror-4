Description: Latex codec
        ===========
        
        This package installs codecs that allow
        to convert byte strings (meaning standard Python 2 strings)
        into an equivalent that has all special characters expressed
        as Latex commands.
        
        Example:        
        
        >>> import latexcodec
        >>> print u"Peter Tr\xf6ger".encode("latex")
        >>> print u"Peter Tr\xf6ger".encode("latex_bracket")
        Peter Tr\"oger
        
        The conversion table is generated from the Latex utf-8 inputenc package,
        which should make sure that all relevant characters are covered.
        
        The functionality of this package somehow is a hack, since LaTex encoding
        is not really a codec.
        
        The future plan is to implement this alternatively as invalid character error handler,
        or as transformation codec starting from Python 3.3.
