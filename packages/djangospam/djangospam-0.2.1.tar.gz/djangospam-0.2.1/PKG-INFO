Description: 
        djangospam
        ==========
        
        Django antispam module with an invisible fake comment/contact form and Akismet
        verification.
        
        See http://pythonhosted.org/djangospam for complete documentation. Now
        compatible with both Python 2 and 3.
        
        Fake form use
        -------------
        
        Include `djangospam` in your installed modules (at `settings.py`) and
        insert the following code in your template, **before** the true form::
        
            {% include 'djangospam/form.html' %}
        
        You may also define a `spam_uri` context variable with the
        fake formulary destination URI. If no URI is defined, the form will be posted
        at the same address of the page in which the form has been placed
        (it will be used a
        `<form style="display:none" method="post" action="">...</form>`
        code). The destination address must accept POST requests and should not change
        the database.
        
        Akismet
        -------
        
        Besides including `djangospam` in your installed modules (at `settings.py`),
        you should insert the following code to your models file::
            
            from djangospam import akismet
            
            class MyModel(...):
                ...
            
            try:
                akismet.register(MyModel)
            except akismet.AlreadyModerated:
                pass
            
        You also **must** define the variables below at `settings.py`:
        
        AKISMET_BLOG
            Your home page URL, including http://
        AKISMET_KEY
            Your application key at akismet.com
        AKISMET_USERAGENT
            Your application name
        AKISMET_USERAGENT_VERSION
            Your application version
        DISCARD_SPAM
            If spam should be either automaticaly discarded or marked as not public and
            removed
        
        Results
        -------
        
        The fake form alone is getting 100% efficiency at
        http://www.correioprogressista.com.br/, which used to have more than 200
        spam comments each day. Even so, I recommend using Akismet or another
        spam analysis tool.
