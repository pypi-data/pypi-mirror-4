Description: **********************************************
        Not another software testing framework, please
        **********************************************
        
          *Note: testkraut is still in its infancy -- some of what is written here
          could still be an anticipation of the near future.*
        
        This is a framework for software testing. That being said, testkraut tries to
        minimize the overlap with the scopes of unit testing, regression testing, and
        continuous integration testing. Instead, it aims to complement these kinds of
        testing, and is able to re-use them, or can be integrated with them.
        
        In a nutshell testkraut helps to facilitate statistical analysis of test
        results. In particular, it focuses on two main scenarios:
        
        1. Comparing results of a single (test) implementation across different
           or changing computational environments (think: different operating systems,
           different hardware, or the same machine before an after a software upgrade).
        
        2. Comparing results of different (test) implementations generating similar
           output from identical input (think: performance of various signal detection
           algorithms).
        
        While such things can be done using other available tools as well, testkraut
        aims to provide a lightweight (hence portable), yet comprehensive description
        of a test run. Such a description allows for decoupling test result generation
        and analysis -- opening up the opportunity to "crowd-source" software testing
        efforts, and aggregate results beyond the scope of a single project, lab,
        company, or site.
