create-event-subscription
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates an RDS event notification subscription. This action requires a
topic ARN (Amazon Resource Name) created by either the RDS console,
the SNS console, or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must
create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is
displayed in the SNS console.

You can specify the type of source (SourceType) you want to be
notified of, provide a list of RDS sources (SourceIds) that triggers
the events, and provide a list of event categories (EventCategories)
for events you want to be notified of. For example, you can specify
--source-type = db-instance, --source-ids = mydbinstance1,
mydbinstance2 and --event-categories = Availability, Backup.

If you specify both the --source-type and SourceIds, such as --source-
type = db-instance and SourceIdentifier = myDBInstance1, you will be
notified of all the db-instance events for the specified source. If
you specify a --source-type but do not specify a SourceIdentifier, you
will receive notice of the events for that source type for all your
RDS sources. If you do not specify either the --source-type nor the
SourceIdentifier, you will be notified of events generated from all
RDS sources belonging to your customer account.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws rds create-event-subscription
     --sns-topic-arn <value>
     --subscription-name <value>
     [--event-categories <value>]
     [--source-type <value>]
     [--enabled ]
     [--source-ids <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--sns-topic-arn"  (string)
   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic created for event
   notification. The ARN is created by Amazon SNS when you create a
   topic and subscribe to it.

"--subscription-name"  (string)
   The name of the subscription.

   Constraints: The name must be less than 255 characters.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--event-categories"  (list of string)
   A list of event categories for a --source-type that you want to
   subscribe to. You can see a list of the categories for a given
   --source-type in the Events topic in the Amazon RDS User Guide or
   by using the **describe-event-categories** action.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--source-type"  (string)
   The type of source that will be generating the events. For example,
   if you want to be notified of events generated by a DB instance,
   you would set this parameter to db-instance. if this value is not
   specified, all events are returned.

   Valid values: db-instance | db-parameter-group | db-security-group
   | db-snapshot

"--enabled"  (boolean)
   A Boolean value; set to **true** to activate the subscription, set
   to **false** to create the subscription but not active it.

"--source-ids"  (list of string)
   The list of identifiers of the event sources for which events will
   be returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the
   response. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain
   only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it cannot end with a
   hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

   Constraints:

   * If --source-ids are supplied, --source-type must also be
     provided.

   * If the source type is a DB instance, then a DBInstanceIdentifier
     must be supplied.

   * If the source type is a DB security group, a DBSecurityGroupName
     must be supplied.

   * If the source type is a DB parameter group, a
     DBParameterGroupName must be supplied.

   * If the source type is a DB Snapshot, a DBSnapshotIdentifier must
     be supplied.
