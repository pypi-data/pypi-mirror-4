        Notes
        -----
        
        Comments moderation is implemented with involvement of two stage workflow.
        Comments are created in "private" state and visible only to DiscussionManager
        group of users.
        
        To differentiate between logged-in (registered) commentors and Anonymous
        commentors that pretend to be one person or other one, we use Boldness of
        name. The Comment author is in bold when posted by logged in member. The
        names provided when posting Anonymously are in plain text.
        
        Notification subject control allows to enter custom prefix to distinct
        notifications coming from different sites.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        One of possible UseCases:
        
        Moderation is enabled and authors notification is turned on.
        
        - New comment posted in private state.
        - Notification is sent to the emails entered in Plone Comments configlet.
        - Moderator User with DiscussionManager role see the comment.
        - The comment can be deleted or published on modaration stage.
        - When comment is published notification is sent to Article Editor.

        Installation
        ============
        
        If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``quintagroup.plonecomments`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                quintagroup.plonecomments
               
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                quintagroup.plonecomments
                quintagroup.plonecomments-overrides
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
        
        * Restart the Zope server, for example, with the following command in the terminal::
        
            $ ./bin/instance restart
        
        * Install quintagroup.plonecomments via ZMI portal_setup. Select ``quintagroup.plonecomments``
          from the list of available profiles and press *Import all steps*.
        
        
          **Atention**: If you are using a Plone version **before** 3.1 you need to install
          "plone.browserlayer":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.browserlayer (which also
          requires a "GenericSetup":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.GenericSetup version
          greater than 1.4) in your Plone site. It shows up as **Local browser layer support**
          in the Plone Add-on Products Control Panel.
