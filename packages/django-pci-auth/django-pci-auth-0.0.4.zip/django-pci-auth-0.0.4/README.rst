django-pci-auth
===============

**Django 1.4+ only**

This library integrates the current Django "best of" PCI auth libraries into a single application, then fills in the gaps. Filling gaps may involve making additional decisions for you, as suggested by Django Documentation e.g.:

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#using-bcrypt-with-django
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#increasing-the-work-factor
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/http/sessions/#session-cookie-age

Or in some cases additional functionality may be provided by this library e.g.:

- Database models to persist event data e.g. lockouts

Features
--------

- Stronger password hashing that allows for selection of hashing algorithm scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2, etc. via settings.py. [1]
- Checking for strong passwords with a default length setting overrideable in settings.py. [2]
- Integrate strong passwords into Django Admin.
- Lock out account for n minutes after x failed log-in attempts. [3]
- Set inactivity timeouts.
- Generate event/email when lock-out occurs.
- Set flags disallowing certain accounts to be locked out.
- Log every log-on and explicit log-out (not necessary to log timed out log-ins).
- Track last four passwords and do not allow re-use.
- Force password reset after X amount of time.

**XXX Below not done**

- Provide JavaScript to check for strong passwords inline.

  - Javascript code should check the Django settings via AJAX re: password length min/max, etc.

Installation
------------

Before you use this library in your applications you may wish to demo its functionality. To do so, follow these steps::

    $ virtualenv .
    $ bin/pip install django-pci-auth
    $ bin/django-admin.py syncdb --settings=django_pci_auth.settings
    $ bin/django-admin.py runserver --settings=django_pci_auth.settings

Stronger password hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a built-in feature in Django 1.4+. Documented here for convenience::

    PASSWORD_HASHERS = (
        # From https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/:
        # "[redacted] This means that Django will use the first hash in the list
        # to store all passwords, but will support checking passwords stored with
        # the rest of the hashes in the list. If you remove a hash from the list
        # it will no longer be supported.
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptPasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.CryptPasswordHasher',
    )

Password Reuse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How many old passwords will you store? This feature will prevent users from using the same passwords over and over again; it will keep the last ``OLD_PASSWORD_STORAGE_NUM`` number of passwords around and remove anything older. E.g.::

    OLD_PASSWORD_STORAGE_NUM = 4
