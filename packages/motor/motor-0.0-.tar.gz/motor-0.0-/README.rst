About
=====

Motor presents a Tornado_ callback-based API for non-blocking access to
MongoDB. The source is `on GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/motor>`_ and the
docs are on ReadTheDocs_.

Issues / Questions / Feedback
=============================

Any issues with, questions about, or feedback for Motor should be sent to the
mongodb-user list on Google Groups. For confirmed issues or feature requests,
open a case on `jira <http://jira.mongodb.org>`_ in the "MOTOR" project. Please
do not e-mail the author directly with issues or questions - you're more likely
to get an answer on the list.

Installation
============

  $ pip install motor

Dependencies
============

Motor works in all the environments officially supported by Tornado_. It
requires:

* Unix, including Mac OS X. Microsoft Windows is not officially supported.
* PyMongo_
* Tornado_
* `Greenlet <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greenlet>`_
* CPython 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, or 3.3
* Although Motor works with PyPy 1.9, limitations with greenlets and PyPy's
  JIT compiler make PyPy applications that use Motor too slow to use. We
  eagerly await improvements in PyPy 2.0.

Additional dependencies are:

- (to generate documentation) sphinx_
- (to auto-discover tests) nose_

Documentation
=============

You will need sphinx_ installed to generate the documentation. Documentation
can be generated by running ``python setup.py doc``. Generated documentation
can be found in ``doc/build/html/``. You can read the current docs
at ReadTheDocs_.

Examples
========

See the `examples on ReadTheDocs <https://motor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples/index.html>`_
or `Chirp, a dumb Twitter clone <https://github.com/ajdavis/chirp>`_.



Testing
=======

The easiest way to run the tests is to install nose_ and run ``nosetests``
or ``python setup.py test`` in the root of the distribution. Tests are
located in the ``test/`` directory.
