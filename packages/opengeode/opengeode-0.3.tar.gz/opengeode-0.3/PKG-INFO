        Installation
        ============
        
        Pre-requisites
        --------------
        
        You need Pyside (the Qt bindings for Python) and the ANTLR runtime to be
        able to run OpenGEODE.
        
        On Debian-based distributions (including Ubuntu):
        
        $ apt-get install python-pyside pip
        $ pip install antlr_python_runtime
        
        On Windows:
        
        You need to download and install Python, Pyside, and pip (binaries are
        available on respective websites)
        
        Then using pip from the command line, you can get the ANTLR runtime:
        
        c:\> pip install antlr_python_runtime
        
        On FreeBSD:
        
        PySide is available through the ports.
        You can also use easy_install to install it.
        Use pip to install the ANTLR runtime (see above)
        
        Automatic installation
        ----------------------
        
        $ pip install opengeode
        
        This is sufficient to get opengeode running. However, if you want to build
        complete systems you need to use OpenGEODE within the TASTE environment.
        
        Full installation
