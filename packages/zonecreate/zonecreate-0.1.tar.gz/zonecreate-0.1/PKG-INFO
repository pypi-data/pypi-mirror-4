Description: zonecreate
        ==========
        
        zonecreate is a very simple Python project that contains a couple of different
        scripts/templates that make it easier to manage various different zone files
        that are in the standard zone file format (BIND/NSD).
        
        
        Scripts
        -------
        
         - zone_create
            Is used to create a new zone file, contains the standard stuff, SOA record
            and some NS records. Nothing else.
        
         - zone_update_soa
            This is used to update the SOA record of a zone file. Given a zone file it
            will grab the current SOA record, and update the serial number to the
            current date + a counter. This way the zone file can be updated twice in
            the same day and the serial will correctly have increased.
        
        Hacking
        -------
        
        If you would like to hack on this project, you can do it as follows:
        
            $ virtualenv --distribute .venv
            
            $ . .venv/bin/activate
            
            $ python setup.py develop
        
        This will set up a new virtualenv and start development, it will also install
        all the scripts under their bin names.
