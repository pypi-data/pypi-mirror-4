Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        `collective.indexing`_ is an approach to provide an abstract framework for
        queuing and optimizing index operations in `Plone`_ as well as dispatching
        them to various backends. The default implementation aims to replace the
        standard indexing mechanism of `CMF`_ to allow index operations to be handled
        asynchronously in a backwards-compatible way.
        
        Queuing these operations on a transaction level allows to get rid of redundant
        indexing of objects and thereby providing a substantial performance
        improvement.  By leveraging the component architecture and Zope event system
        `collective.indexing`_ also makes it much easier to use backends other
        than or in addition to the standard portal catalog for indexing, such as
        dedicated search engine solutions like `Solr`_, `Xapian`_ or `Google Search
        Appliance`_.  One backend implementation designed to be used with this package
        has already been started in the form of `collective.solr`_.

        Current Status
        ==============
        
        The implementation is considered to be ready for production. It can be
        installed in a Plone 4.x site to enable indexing operations to be queued,
        optimized and dispatched to the standard portal catalog on the Zope
        transaction boundary thereby improving the Plone's out-of-the-box
        performance_.
        
          .. _performance: http://www.jarn.com/blog/plone-indexing-performance
        
        At the moment the package requires several "monkey patches", to the mixin
        classes currently used to hook up indexing, i.e. ``CMFCatalogAware``
        and ``CatalogMultiplex``, the portal catalog as well as to helper methods in
        `Plone`_ itself. It is planned to clear these up by making the classes
        "pluggable" via adapterization, allowing `collective.indexing`_ to hook in in
        clean ways.
        
        In conjunction with `collective.solr`_ the package also provides a
        working solution for integration of `Solr`_ with `Plone`_.  Based on a schema
        `configurable`__ at `zc.buildout`_ level indexing operations can be dispatched
        a `Solr`_ instance in addition or alternatively to the standard catalog.  This
        allows for minimal and very efficient indexing of standard `Plone`_ content
        items based on Archetypes. Providing support for other content types is
        rather trivial and will be support soon.
        
          .. __: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.recipe.solrinstance/
          .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        The code was written with emphasis on minimalism, clarity and maintainability.
        It comes with extensive tests covering the code base at more than 95%. The
        package is currently in use in several production sites and considered stable.
        
        For outstanding issues and features remaining to be implemented please see the
        `issue tracker`__.

        Subscriber Support
        ------------------
        
        The package comes with support for queueing up and performing indexing
        operations via event subscribers.  The idea behind this is to not rely on
        explicit calls as defined in ``CMFCatalogAware`` alone, but instead make it
        possible to phase them out eventually. As the additional indexing operations
        added via the subscribers are optimized away anyway, this only adds very
        little processing overhead.
        
        However, even though ``IObjectModifiedEvent`` has support for partial
        reindexing by passing a list of descriptions/index names, this is currently
        not used anywhere in Plone. Unfortunately that means that partial reindex
        operations will be "upgraded" to full reindexes, e.g. for
        ``IContainerModifiedEvent`` via the ``notifyContainerModified`` helper,
        which is one reason why subscriber support is not enabled by default for now.
        
        To activate please use::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            zcml = collective.indexing:subscribers.zcml
        
        instead of just the package name itself, re-run buildout and restart your
        Plone instance.

        **"OFS.Uninstalled Could not import class '...' from module '...'" Warnings**
        
        Symptom
          When loading your Plone site after a Zope restart, i.e. when browsing it,
          you're seeing warnings like::
        
            WARNING OFS.Uninstalled Could not import class 'PortalCatalogQueueProcessor' from module 'collective.indexing.indexer'
            WARNING OFS.Uninstalled Could not import class 'IndexQueueSwitch' from module 'collective.indexing.queue'
        Problem
          Early versions of the package used persistent local utilities, which are
          still present in your ZODB.  These utilities have meanwhile been replaced
          and the old instances aren't needed anymore.
        Solution
          Please simply re-install the package via Plone's control panel or the
          quick-installer.  Alternatively you can also use the ZMI "Components" tab
          on your site root object, typically located at
          http://localhost:8080/plone/manage_components, to remove the broken
          utilities from the XML.  Search for "broken".

        * Change the dependency on Archetypes into a soft one.
          [witsch]
        
        * Also monkey-patch Archetypes' `BaseBTreeFolder`, which keeps references
          to the methods from `CMFCatalogAware` as it is usually initialized before
          the patched methods are in place.
          [witsch]

          details of the functions under test.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Adjusted tests to set a site explicitly in the layer.
          [hannosch]

          issuing a query (aka auto-flush).
          [stefan]
        
        * Fix test isolation issues and improve test setup.
          [witsch]
        
        * Made sure QueueReducer sorts results by opcode. Unindex operations must
          be handled before (re)index operations.
          [stefan]
        
        * Added processQueue function to process a queue immediately.

          [stefan]
        
        
        1.0b4 - Released June 30th, 2008
        --------------------------------
        
        * Perform processing of the queue during "active" state of the transaction
          as additional changes are forbidden in "committing" state.  Those changes
          can for example be caused by indexes writing back data to content items,
          such as the modification time.
          [witsch, mj]
        
        
        1.0b3 - Released June 18th, 2008

          potentially not be deleted.
          [witsch]
        
        
        1.0b2 - Released June 2nd, 2008
        -------------------------------

        1.0b1 - Released May 28, 2008
        -----------------------------
        
        * Make sure we get REQUEST correctly in PathWrapper.
          [tesdal]
        
        
        1.0a3 - Released May 28, 2008
        -----------------------------
        
        * Respect overridden indexing methods to prevent erroneous indexing and
          generally allow special handling.
          [witsch]
        
        * Fix leftover index entry after renaming an object.
          [witsch]
