Introduction
============

The normal Plone 'move' and 'copy' content rules do not take translations of
the specified target folder into account. Instead, all objects, regardless of
their language, are moved/copied to the single specified folder.

This product provides two custom Plone Content Rules. 

    - LinguaMove
    - LinguaCopy 
    
The purpose of which is to move or copy objects to the correct language version 
(translation) of the specified target folder.
