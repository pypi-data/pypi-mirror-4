Link State Definitions
======================

The following state names are defined for the use within gocept.linkchecker.
They are protocol independent.

green
    Means everything is ok with this link, nothing to worry about. The link
    will work as expected by the author.

orange
    The link doesn't work but the response hints that this might be a temporary
    problem. (E.g. DNS resolution failures)

red
    The link doesn't work and the response from the server hints that this is a
    hard problem (E.g. HTTP 404)

grey
    There is no information about this link currently available.

In addition to the link state there is a 'reason' field that stores (protocol
dependent) information why the link is currently in the given state.
