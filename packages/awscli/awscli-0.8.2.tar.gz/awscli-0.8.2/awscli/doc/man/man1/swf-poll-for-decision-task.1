.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by deciders to get a  DecisionTask from the specified decision
\fB\-\-task\-list\fP . A decision task may be returned for any open workflow
execution that is using the specified task list. The task includes a paginated
view of the history of the workflow execution. The decider should use the
workflow type and the history to determine how to properly handle the task.
.sp
This action initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection
open and responds as soon a task becomes available. If no decision task is
available in the specified task list before the timeout of 60 seconds expires,
an empty result is returned. An empty result, in this context, means that a
DecisionTask is returned, but that the value of taskToken is an empty string.
.IP Warning
Deciders should set their client side socket timeout to at least 70 seconds
(10 seconds higher than the timeout).
.RE
.IP Warning
Because the number of workflow history events for a single workflow execution
might be very large, the result returned might be split up across a number of
pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make additional calls to
\fBpoll\-for\-decision\-task\fP using the \fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP returned by the
initial call. Note that you do \fBnot\fP call \fBget\-workflow\-execution\-history\fP
with this \fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP . Instead, call \fBpoll\-for\-decision\-task\fP
again.

\fBAccess Control\fP
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the \-\-domain name to limit the action to only
specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBCondition\fP element with the \fBswf:taskList.name\fP key to allow the
action to access only certain task lists.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails by
throwing \fBOperationNotPermitted\fP . For details and example IAM policies, see
\fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-domain\fP  (string)
The name of the \-\-domain containing the task lists to poll.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-task\-list\fP  (structure)
Specifies the task list to poll for decision tasks.
.sp
The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not
contain a \fB:\fP (colon), \fB/\fP (slash), \fB|\fP (vertical bar), or any control
characters (u0000\-u001f | u007f \- u009f). Also, it must not contain the
literal string arn.

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP  (string)
If on a previous call to this method a \fBNextPageToken\fP was returned, the
results are being paginated. To get the next page of results, repeat the call
with the returned token and all other arguments unchanged.
.IP Note
The \fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP returned by this action cannot be used with
get\-workflow\-execution\-history to get the next page. You must call
poll\-for\-decision\-task again (with the \fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP ) to retrieve
the next page of history records. Calling  poll\-for\-decision\-task with a
\fB\-\-next\-page\-token\fP will not return a new decision task.

.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-reverse\-order\fP  (boolean)
When set to \fBtrue\fP , returns the events in reverse order. By default the
results are returned in ascending order of the \fBeventTimestamp\fP of the
events.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-maximum\-page\-size\fP  (integer)
The maximum number of history events returned in each page. The default is
100, but the caller can override this value to a page size \fIsmaller\fP than the
default. You cannot specify a page size greater than 100. Note that the number
of events may be less than the maxiumum page size, in which case, the returned
page will have fewer results than the \-\-maximum\-page\-size specified.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-identity\fP  (string)
Identity of the decider making the request, which is recorded in the
DecisionTaskStarted event in the workflow history. This enables diagnostic
tracing when problems arise. The form of this \-\-identity is user defined.
