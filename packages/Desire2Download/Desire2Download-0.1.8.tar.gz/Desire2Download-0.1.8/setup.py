   d2d is a tool to download all of the content from the University of Waterloo's
   new learning management system which uses Desire2Learn instead of the old Angel
   based UWACE.

   d2d was inspired by Jamie Wong's fabulous UWAngel-CLI (https://github.com/phleet/UWAngel-CLI)
   written in Ruby.

   d2d is somewhat hacky and has not been tested extensively. If you do find a bug,
   please let me know (stephen.holiday@gmail.com).

   To install, just do:

       python setup.py install

   Using d2d is easy:

       d2d --username scholida -i ".*.wmv"

        + ECE 224 - Fall 2011/Labs/Lab 1/lab1_checklist-s2010.pdf (107.65K)

       ...


   d2d will not download a file if it has been already saved.
