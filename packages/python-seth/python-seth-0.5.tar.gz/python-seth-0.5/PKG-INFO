Description: python-seth is a pretty simple object named Daemon used to daemonize a process.
        
        To do so subclass the Daemon object and override its run method with the code
        you want to turn into a unix daemon.
        
        You can override the shutdown method which is called on Daemon stop (either via
        the stop method or on SIGTERM).
        
        Cf. examples for code snippet.
        
        
        FEATURES:
        	* redirects stderr|stdout to file
        	* writes a pid file
        	* transparently deletes the pid file at stop
        	* catch SIGTERM and handles a clean stop via shutdown method
