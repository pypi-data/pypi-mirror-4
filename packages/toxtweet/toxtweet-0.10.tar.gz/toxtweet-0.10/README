Python files for Toxicovigilance on Twitter

What is it?
------------

 A collection of Python files, also listed on PyPI, as part of an ongoing effort to use Twitter for toxicology research. 

How do I use it?
-----------------

 The easiest thing is to copy all of the files to someplace in your PYTHONPATH, like ~/bin. 

 RUN PYTHON MAIN.PY 

 This module creates a twitteryQuery.py object for all drugs listed in the formulary. It can save the results in JSON or XLS. 


What other Python Plugins do I need?
_____________________________________

 -Numpy/SciPy
 -XLRD XLWT
 -python-twitter (use pip install twitter not easy_install twitter)
 -matplotlib
 -simplejson
 -networkx


What do the files besides main.py do?
______________________________________

--->twitterQuery.py: main.py creates an instance of twitterQuery for each drug in the "formulary" that you are â€¦ querying Twitter for. 

--->parser.py loads the JSON format results from querying twitter and formats them for NLP analysis by:
 1. Writing a reduplicated record of the tweets to an XLS file for human rating. (Change filename, which indicates the location of the JSON dump of the twitter query, as needed.) 
 2. Making a stemmed corpus to use for semantic analysis, contextual analysis or as input to a classifier. (Change the savename as needed.)

--->loadTweets.py is a helper function to calculate the Fleisch-Kincaid grade level of a tweet. 

---> medgraph.py draws a degree-rank plot with the social graph as an inset.
