modify-cluster
**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Modifies the settings for a cluster. For example, you can add another
security or parameter group, update the preferred maintenance window,
or change the master user password. Resetting a cluster password or
modifying the security groups associated with a cluster do not need a
reboot. However, modifying parameter group requires a reboot for
parameters to take effect.

You can also change node type and the number of nodes to scale up or
down the cluster. When resizing a cluster, you must specify both the
number of nodes and the node type even if one of the parameters does
not change. If you specify the same number of nodes and node type that
are already configured for the cluster, an error is returned.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--cluster-identifier"  (string)
   The unique identifier of the cluster to be modified.

   Example: "examplecluster"


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--node-type"  (string)
   The new node type of the cluster. If you specify a new node type,
   you must also specify the number of nodes parameter also.

   When you submit your request to resize a cluster, Amazon Redshift
   sets access permissions for the cluster to read-only. After Amazon
   Redshift provisions a new cluster according to your resize
   requirements, there will be a temporary outage while the old
   cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new
   cluster. When the new connection is complete, the original access
   permissions for the cluster are restored. You can use the
   describe-resize to track the progress of the resize request.

   Valid Values: "dw.hs1.xlarge" | "dw.hs1.8xlarge"

"--cluster-parameter-group-name"  (string)
   The name of the cluster parameter group to apply to this cluster.
   This change is applied only after the cluster is rebooted. To
   reboot a cluster use reboot-cluster .

   Default: Uses existing setting.

   Constraints: The cluster parameter group must be in the same
   parameter group family that matches the cluster version.

"--cluster-type"  (string)
   The new cluster type.

   When you submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster
   goes into a read-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new
   cluster based on your resize requirements, there will be outage for
   a period while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is
   switched to the new cluster. You can use describe-resize to track
   the progress of the resize request.

   Valid Values: >>``<<multi-node | single-node ``

"--master-user-password"  (string)
   The new password for the cluster master user. This change is
   asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the
   request and the completion of the request, the "--master-user-
   password" element exists in the "PendingModifiedValues" element of
   the operation response. .. note:

      Operations never return the password, so this operation provides a way to
      regain access to the master user account for a cluster if the password is
      lost.

   Default: Uses existing setting.

   Constraints:

   * Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length.

   * Must contain at least one uppercase letter.

   * Must contain at least one lowercase letter.

   * Must contain one number.

   * Can be any printable ASCII character (ASCII code 33 to 126)
     except ' (single quote), " (double quote), , /, @, or space.

"--vpc-security-group-ids"  (list of string)
   A list of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups to be
   associated with the cluster.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--allow-version-upgrade"  (boolean)
   If "true" , upgrades will be applied automatically to the cluster
   during the maintenance window.

   Default: "false"

"--preferred-maintenance-window"  (string)
   The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can
   occur, if necessary. If system maintenance is necessary during the
   window, it may result in an outage.

   This maintenance window change is made immediately. If the new
   maintenance window indicates the current time, there must be at
   least 120 minutes between the current time and end of the window in
   order to ensure that pending changes are applied.

   Default: Uses existing setting.

   Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi, for example "wed:07:30-wed:08:00"
   .

   Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

   Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes.

"--automated-snapshot-retention-period"  (integer)
   The number of days that automated snapshots are retained. If the
   value is 0, automated snapshots are disabled. Even if automated
   snapshots are disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when
   you want with create-cluster-snapshot .

   If you decrease the automated snapshot retention period from its
   current value, existing automated snapshots which fall outside of
   the new retention period will be immediately deleted.

   Default: Uses existing setting.

   Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.

"--cluster-security-groups"  (list of string)
   A list of cluster security groups to be authorized on this cluster.
   This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

   Security groups currently associated with the cluster and not in
   the list of groups to apply, will be revoked from the cluster.

   Constraints:

   * Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens

   * First character must be a letter

   * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--number-of-nodes"  (integer)
   The new number of nodes of the cluster. If you specify a new number
   of nodes, you must also specify the node type parameter also.

   When you submit your request to resize a cluster, Amazon Redshift
   sets access permissions for the cluster to read-only. After Amazon
   Redshift provisions a new cluster according to your resize
   requirements, there will be a temporary outage while the old
   cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new
   cluster. When the new connection is complete, the original access
   permissions for the cluster are restored. You can use  describe-
   resize to track the progress of the resize request.

   Valid Values: Integer greater than "0" .

"--cluster-version"  (string)
   The new version number of the Amazon Redshift engine to upgrade to.

   For major version upgrades, if a non-default cluster parameter
   group is currently in use, a new cluster parameter group in the
   cluster parameter group family for the new version must be
   specified. The new cluster parameter group can be the default for
   that cluster parameter group family.

   Example: "1.0"
