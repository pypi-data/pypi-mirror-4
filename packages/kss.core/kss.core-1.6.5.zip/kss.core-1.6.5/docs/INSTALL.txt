kss.core Installation
=====================

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install kss.core``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Copy the files called ``kss/core/kss.core-configure.zcml`` 
   and ``kss/core/kss.core-meta.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory. 
   *You do not need to do this if you use kss with Plone.*
