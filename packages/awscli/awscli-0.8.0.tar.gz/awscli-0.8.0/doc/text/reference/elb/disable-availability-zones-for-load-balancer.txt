disable-availability-zones-for-load-balancer
********************************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Removes the specified EC2 Availability Zones from the set of
configured Availability Zones for the LoadBalancer.

There must be at least one Availability Zone registered with a
LoadBalancer at all times. A client cannot remove all the Availability
Zones from a LoadBalancer. Once an Availability Zone is removed, all
the instances registered with the LoadBalancer that are in the removed
Availability Zone go into the OutOfService state. Upon Availability
Zone removal, the LoadBalancer attempts to equally balance the traffic
among its remaining usable Availability Zones. Trying to remove an
Availability Zone that was not associated with the LoadBalancer does
nothing.

Note: In order for this call to be successful, the client must have
  created the LoadBalancer. The client must provide the same account
  credentials as those that were used to create the LoadBalancer.
