describe-vpcs
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your VPCs. You can filter the results to
return information only about VPCs that match criteria you specify.

For example, you could ask to get information about a particular VPC
or VPCs (or all your VPCs) only if the VPC's state is available. You
can specify multiple filters (e.g., the VPC uses one of several sets
of DHCP options, and the VPC's state is available). The result
includes information for a particular VPC only if the VPC matches all
your filters.

If there's no match, no special message is returned; the response is
simply empty. The following table shows the available filters.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for VPCs. For a complete
   reference to the available filter keys for this operation, see the
   Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.
