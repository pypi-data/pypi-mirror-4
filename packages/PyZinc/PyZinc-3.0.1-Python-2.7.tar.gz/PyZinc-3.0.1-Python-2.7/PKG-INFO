        ======
        
        PyZinc provides a python interface to the Zinc visualisation library.  There are some examples of using PyZinc available at https://somwhere.like.here.  A typical usage often starts with creating a Context like this::
        
            #!/usr/bin/python
        
            from pyzinc import Context
        
            c = Context.Context.create("my-context")
        
        There are some very cool things you can visualise with this library, like DICOM images, Hermite meshes and so on.
