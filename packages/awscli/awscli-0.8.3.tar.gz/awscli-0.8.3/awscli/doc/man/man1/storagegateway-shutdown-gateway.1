.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use
the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.
.sp
The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the storage
gateway\(aqs virtual machine (VM) and not the VM.
.IP Note
If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down
the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.
.RE
.sp
After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except
start\-gateway ,  describe\-gateway\-information , and  list\-gateways . For more
information, see  activate\-gateway . Your applications cannot read from or write
to the gateway\(aqs storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.
.IP Note
When you make a shutdown request, you will get a \fB200 OK\fP success response
immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to shut down.
You can call the  describe\-gateway\-information API to check the status. For
more information, see  activate\-gateway .
.RE
.sp
If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using
delete\-gateway ) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.
