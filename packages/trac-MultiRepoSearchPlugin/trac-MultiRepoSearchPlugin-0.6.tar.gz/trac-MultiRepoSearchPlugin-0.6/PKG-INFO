Description: To install::
        
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python setup.py develop
        
        Add to your trac.conf::
        
          [components]
          multireposearch.* = enabled
        
        Upgrade your trac environment::
        
          trac-admin path/to/env upgrade
        
        Prepare all available repositories with an initial indexing::
        
          trac-admin path/to/env multireposearch reindex_all
        
        You will now be able to perform text searches of repository contents through the trac search UI.
        
        As long as you have your trac post-commit or post-receive hooks properly configured, 
        source will remain up-to-date.
        
        Otherwise, to manually reindex a single repository, you ca run::
        
          trac-admin path/to/env multireposearch reindex repo-name
        
        Where repo-name is the name assigned to your repository in Trac.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.6 (2013-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        * The plugin's search source is now off by default, so Trac searches will not include
          source code results unless the user explicitly checks the "Source Repository" box
          on the search form.  This way the plugin won't impact performance of searches unless
          the user actually wants to search through source code.  (This behavior may change 
          in the future, but not until there exists a search backend that's faster than unindexed
          full text search on a database column.)
        
        0.5 (2013-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        * Selectively reindex only the files that were changed or added in each changeset, rather than
          reindexing the entire repository. (http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/9790)
        
        0.4 (2013-01-11)
        ----------------
        
        * Errors will no longer occur when repositories or files are removed from the underlying
           system but still referenced in the search backend's list of search results.
           (http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/9791, http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/10792, http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/10793)
        * Removed broken index on text contents for new installations (http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/10619)
        
        0.3 (2012-09-28)
        ----------------
        
        * Search backends are now expected to match against filenames as well as file contents.
          The provided SQLIndexer component has been updated to search for filenames as well.
