Using (py)inotify to run commands when files change
===================================================

Tired of switching console, arrow-up, Enter, switch console back for
every little change you make when you're writing code that has tests?
Running with ``gorun.py`` enables you to just save in your editor and
the tests are run automatically and immediately.

``gorun.py`` does not use a slow pulling process which keeps taps on
files modification time. Instead it uses the inotify_ which is "a Linux kernel
subsystem that provides file system event notification".

.. _inotify: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify


Installation
------------

This will only work on Linux which has the inotify module enabled in
the kernel. (Most modern kernels do)

::

    pip install gorun

This will install pyinotify_.

.. _pyinotify: http://trac.dbzteam.org/pyinotify

Then, create a settings file, which is just a python file that is expected to
define a variable called ``DIRECTORIES``. Here's an example:

::

    DIRECTORIES = (
       ('some/place/', './myframework test --dir some/place'),
       ('some/place/unitests.py',
        './myframework test --dir some/place --testclass Unittests'),
       ('/var/log/torrentsdownload.log',
        'growl downloads --logfile /var/log/torrentsdownload.log'),
    )

Save that file as, for example, ``gorun_settings.py`` and then start it
like this:

::

    $ gorun.py gorun_settings

Configuration
-------------

Once you've set gorun to monitor a directory it will kick off on any
file that changes in that directory. By default things like autosave
files from certain editors are automatically created (e.g. #foo.py# or
foo.py~) and these are ignored. If there are other file extensions you
want gorun to ignore add this to your settings file:

::

    IGNORE_EXTENSIONS = ('log',)

This will add to the list of already ignored file extensions such as
``.pyc``.

Similarly, if there are certain directories that you don't want the
inotify to notice, you can list them like this:

::

    IGNORE_DIRECTORIES = ('xapian_index', '.autosavefiles')

Disclaimer
----------

This code hasn't been extensively tested and relies on importing
python modules so don't let untrusted morons fiddle with your dev
environment.

Todo
----

When doing Django development I often run on single test method over
and over and over again till I get rid of all errors. When doing this
I have to change the settings so it just runs one single test and when
I'm done I go back to set it up so that it runs all tests when adjacent
code works.

This is a nuisance and I might try to solve that one day. If you have
any tips please let me know.
