update-auto-scaling-group
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Updates the configuration for the specified  AutoScalingGroup .

Note: To update an Auto Scaling group with a launch configuration that has
  the "InstanceMonitoring" flag set to "False" , you must first ensure
  that collection of group metrics is disabled. Otherwise, calls to
  update-auto-scaling-group will fail. If you have previously enabled
  group metrics collection, you can disable collection of all group
  metrics by calling disable-metrics-collection .

The new settings are registered upon the completion of this call. Any
launch configuration settings take effect on any triggers after this
call returns. Triggers that are currently in progress aren't affected.

Note: * If a new value is specified for *--min-size* without specifying
    the value for *--desired-capacity* , and if the new *--min-size*
    is larger than the current size of the Auto Scaling Group, there
    will be an implicit call to set-desired-capacity to set the group
    to the new *--min-size* .

  * If a new value is specified for *--max-size* without specifying
    the value for *--desired-capacity* , and the new *--max-size* is
    smaller than the current size of the Auto Scaling Group, there
    will be an implicit call to set-desired-capacity to set the group
    to the new *--max-size* .

  * All other optional parameters are left unchanged if not passed in
    the request.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--auto-scaling-group-name"  (string)
   The name of the Auto Scaling group.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--health-check-grace-period"  (integer)
   The length of time that Auto Scaling waits before checking an
   instance's health status. The grace period begins when an instance
   comes into service.

"--placement-group"  (string)
   The name of the cluster placement group, if applicable. For more
   information, go to Using Cluster Instances in the Amazon EC2 User
   Guide.

"--desired-capacity"  (integer)
   The desired capacity for the Auto Scaling group.

"--termination-policies"  (list of string)
   A standalone termination policy or a list of termination policies
   used to select the instance to terminate. The policies are executed
   in the order that they are listed.

   For more information on creating a termination policy for your Auto
   Scaling group, go to Instance Termination Policy for Your Auto
   Scaling Group in the the *Auto Scaling Developer Guide* .

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--default-cooldown"  (integer)
   The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes
   before any further trigger-related scaling activities can start.

"--min-size"  (integer)
   The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.

"--max-size"  (integer)
   The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.

"--vpc-zone-identifier"  (string)
   The subnet identifier for the Amazon VPC connection, if applicable.
   You can specify several subnets in a comma-separated list.

   When you specify "--vpc-zone-identifier" with "--availability-
   zones" , ensure that the subnets' Availability Zones match the
   values you specify for "--availability-zones" .

"--launch-configuration-name"  (string)
   The name of the launch configuration.

"--availability-zones"  (list of string)
   Availability Zones for the group.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--health-check-type"  (string)
   The service of interest for the health status check, either "EC2"
   for Amazon EC2 or "ELB" for Elastic Load Balancing.
