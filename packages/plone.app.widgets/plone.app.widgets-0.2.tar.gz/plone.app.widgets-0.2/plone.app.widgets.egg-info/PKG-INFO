Description: ``plone.app.widgets`` is a revamp of plone widgets. It does this by overriding
        the widgets of some of the fields in plone.
        
        .. contents::
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        Widgets that are overridden in ``Edit`` forms are:
        
        - ``subject``
        - ``language``
        - ``effectiveDate``
        - ``expirationDate``
        - ``contributrors``
        - ``creators``
        
        Currently ``plone.app.widgets`` only works with Archetypes, but Dexterity
        support is planned in next release.
        
        All client side code (javascript/css/images) is done and tested as part of
        `Plone Mockup`_ project.
        
        Any feature / bug / compliment please insert in `issue tracker`_.
