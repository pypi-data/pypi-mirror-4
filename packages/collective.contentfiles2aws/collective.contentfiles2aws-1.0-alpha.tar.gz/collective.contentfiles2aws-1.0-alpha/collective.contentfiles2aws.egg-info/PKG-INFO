Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package brings to Plone the ability to store files and images on
        amazon s3 service.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The main idea is to move content images and files to amazon
        CDN which serves content to end users with high availability and high
        performance. The package contains two content types: AWSFile and AWSImage
        which work similar to the default ones. The main difference is that they
        store their content on amazon simple storage instead of Plone site.
