********************************
* The LAAS-CNRS dialogs module *
********************************

(c) LAAS-CNRS 2010-2011

This module reads on stdin user input in natural language, parse it, call 
resolution routines when ambiguous concepts are used, and finally generate RDF 
statements that are an interpretation of the input.

It includes as well a verbalization module that conversely turns RDF statements
into a sentence in natural language.

dialogs fits into the so-called CHRIS architecture @ LAAS. More details on the 
LAAS internal Wiki:
