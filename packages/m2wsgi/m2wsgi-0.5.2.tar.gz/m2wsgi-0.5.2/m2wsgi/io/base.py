m2wsgi.bio.base:  abstract base I/O classes for m2wsgi
======================================================

This module contains the base implementations of various m2wsgi classes.
Many of them are abstract, so don't use this module directly.
We have the following classes:

    :Connection:     represents the connection from your handler to Mongrel2,
                     through which you can read requests and send responses.

    :Client:         represents a client connected to the server, to whom you
                     can send data at any time.

    :Request:        represents a client request to which you can send
                     response data to at any time.

    :Handler:        a base class for implementing handlers, with nothing
                     WSGI-specific in it.

    :WSGIHandler:    a handler subclass specifically running a WSGI app.


    :WSGIResponder:  a class for managing the stateful aspects of a WSGI
                     response (status line, write callback, etc).
