	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>This is an application which allows a user to get information about a stock.  A user can enter a stock ticker symbol and some information about the stock will be displayed as well as the number of mentions in the past few hours.  The stock mentions are based on searching Twitter for the relevant <em>cashtag</em> (eg. $GOOG, $FB).</p>

	<p>This app was created in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>/<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.  Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Bootstrap</a> framework and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> were also used.</p>
	
	<br />

	<h4>Usage:</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Enter a stock symbol in the input box and click <em>Add</em> to add a new stock</li>
			<li>Clicking on a row will display the most recent tweets excluding retweets.</li>
			<li>The number of hours is controllable by the slider.</li>
			<li>The user can click the X beside a stock to remove it from the list.</li>
			<li>Clicking the refresh icon will refresh the page to see if the number of mentions has changed.  The table is sorted based on the number of mentions.</li>
