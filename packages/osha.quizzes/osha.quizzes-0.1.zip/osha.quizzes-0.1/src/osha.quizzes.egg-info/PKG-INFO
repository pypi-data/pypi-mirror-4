        Build quizzes with Plone
        ========================
        
        `osha.quizzes` is a minimalistic Plone add-on that builds on top of the
        `PloneFormGen` product to enable you to build simple quizzes trough-the-web.

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install ``osha.quizzes`` you simply add ``osha.quizzes`` to the list of eggs
        in your buildout, run buildout and restart Plone. Then, install `osha.quizzes`
        using the Add-ons control panel.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
            * `Plone <http://plone.org/>`_ 4.1 or newer
            * `PloneFormGen <http://plone.org/products/ploneformgen>`_ 1.7 or newer
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        This package does the following:
         * extends `FormSelectionField` with a ``correct_answer`` field so users can
           specify the correct answer from a list of options,
         * adds a `PFGCorrectAnwserAdapter` that iterates through all
           `FormSelectionFields` on form submit, calculates the percentage of correct
           answers and displays the result as a portal status message.
         * add a `quizzes` view, registered for `Folders`, that lists all FormFolders
           in a Folder, and opens them in an overlay upon clicking on one.
        
        So, to create a quiz, first create a PloneFormGen's FormFolder, add some
        FormSelectionFields to it and set the correct answer for each of them.
        
        .. image:: https://github.com/syslabcom/osha.quizzes/raw/master/docs/images/correct_answer_field.png
        
        Then add the `PFGCorrectAnswersAdapter` to the FormFolder, give it some
        some arbitrary title and save. No when you fill out the form and click submit,
        you'll get your score in a nice status message.

        Finally you can choose to use the `quizzes` view on a Folder to list all
        quizzes in that folder and open them in overlays.
