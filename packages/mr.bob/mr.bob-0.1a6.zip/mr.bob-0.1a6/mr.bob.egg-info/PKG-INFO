        TODO
        ====
        
        - [medium] ability to use multiple templates at the same time and depend on them (similar templer structures, but doesnt separate structures and templates)
        - [medium] figure out how templates can depend on each other (bobconfig setting with a list of template names?)
        - [medium] gittip
        - [medium] add +var+ folder in template_sample
        - [medium] Check how one would implement multi-namespace python package with current mr.bob api
        - [medium] write/test/document choice question type and corresponding pre_ask_question, post_ask_question
        - [low] Ability to configure what to ignore when copying templates in bobconfig
        - [low] better format print questions output (keep order of questions -> use order information like for asking questions)
        - [low] document we don't need local commands once answers are remembered (just issue another template on top of current)
        - [low] ability to specify variables/defaults to questions from cli
        - [maybe] ability to simulate rendering (dry-run)
        - [maybe] ability to update/patch templates

        =========
            
        
        0.1a6 (2013-01-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Use ``StrictUndefined`` with jinja2 renderer so that any missing key is
          reported as an error
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - If a key in a namespace was missing while rendering, no error was raised
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Added hook ``mrbob.hooks.show_message``
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - ``mrbob.validators.boolean`` renamed to ``mrbob.hooks.to_boolean``
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Renamed ``validators.py`` to ``hooks.py``
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Removed ``validators`` and ``action`` settings from ``[questions]`` as it is
          superseded by hooks
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Added ``pre_ask_question`` and ``post_ask_question`` to ``[questions]`` section
          [Domen Kožar]
          
        - Added ``pre_render``, ``post_render`` and  ``post_render_msg`` options
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Added ``[defaults]`` section that will override template defaults. The only
          difference to ``[variables]`` is that variables provide default answers
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Moved ``renderer`` parameter to ``[template]`` section
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Added ``[template]`` section that is parsed only from ``.mrbob.ini`` inside a
          template directory.
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Correctly evaluate boolean of ``quiet`` and ``verbose`` settings
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Added ``non_interactive`` setting that will not prompt for any input and fail
          if any of required questions are not answered
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Added ``remember_answers`` setting that will create ``.mrbob.ini`` file inside
          rendered directory with all the answers written to ``[variables]`` section
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Include changelog in documentation
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - ``Question`` does no longer raise error if unknown parameter is passed from a
          config file. Instead those parameters are saved to ``question.extra`` that can
          be later inspected and validated. This is first step to have advanced question
          types such as question with a set of predefined answers
          [Domen Kožar]
        
        - Rewrite all py.test stuff to nosetests, so we have unified testing now. This
          also fixes flake8 segfaults on pypy
          [Domen Kožar]

        - Add -q/--quiet option to suppress output which isn't strictly necessary
          [Sasha Hart]
        
        - Suppress the interactive-mode welcome banner if there are no questions to ask
          [Sasha Hart]
        
        - Don't raise KeyError: 'questions_order' if [questions] is missing in an ini
          [Sasha Hart]
