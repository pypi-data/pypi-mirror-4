    Components are laid out in the user interface hierarchically. The layout
    is managed by layout components, or more generally by components that
    implement the L{ComponentContainer} interface. Such a container is
    the I{parent} of the contained components.

    The L{getParent} method allows retrieving the parent component
    of a component. While there is a L{setParent}, you rarely need
    it as you normally add components with the
    L{addComponent()<ComponentContainer.addComponent>} method
    of the layout or other C{ComponentContainer}, which automatically
    sets the parent.

    A component becomes I{attached} to an application (and the
    L{attach} is called) when it or one of its parents is attached to
    the main window of the application through its containment hierarchy.
