<h2><a href="/blog/2009-09-26.html">2009-09-26</a> : Quick Lamson 1.0pre6 Release, More This Weekend</h2>

<p>	<p>I put up a quick release of Lamson that fixes a bug in the gen project prototype.
I recently switched all the domain names being used in the test suite to &#8220;localhost&#8221; or
a similar nonexistant domain name.  Why?  Well, because some people liked to run
the Lamson test suite or their fresh project test suite against a <strong>live</strong> <span class="caps">SMTP</span>
server.  The test suite would &#8220;send&#8221; mail to test@test.com and my own 
address, under the assumption that people would use the <code>lamson log</code> test server.</p></p>

<p>	<p>Lamson 1.0pre2 features two features that might signal the end of the beginning or
the beginning of the end, depending on your perspective: <span class="caps">HTML</span> Email and Lamson Standalone.
<span class="caps">HTML</span> Email support comes from a new module 
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.html-module.html">lamson.html</a> that gives a nice template
method to send out <span class="caps">HTML</span> to victims&#8230;uh&#8230;customers.  Lamson Standalone will be a way
to run Lamson as your customized email server instead of another server like Postfix.</p></p>

<p>	<p>Tonight I&#8217;m releasing Lamson 1.0pre1 with all the latest improvements I&#8217;ve made while
making <a href="http://librelist.com/">librelist.com</a> and taking feedback from a few people
using Lamson.  The goal from now on will be to basically squash bugs and write docs, with
only a rare feature or two as I find them needed on projects.</p></p>

<p>	<p>I was going to release Lamson 0.9.6 much earlier than this, but as I worked on
the bounce detection feature, I realized that if I just wrote that and a few
other cleanups and features, I&#8217;d actually have a <strong>1.0pre1</strong> candidate on my
hands instead of a 0.9.6 release.</p></p>

<p>	<p>I think I&#8217;m at a point where bounce detection and handling works really well and is 
ready for release.  I&#8217;ve got it running on the latest Lamson demo <a href="http://librelist.com/">librelist.com</a>
and it works.  I&#8217;ll be pushing out a new release of Libre List in a little while
that does some advanced bounce handling, and if that all works, then I&#8217;ll push
out 0.9.6.</p></p>

<p>	<p>I just finished committing 0.9.6 code for doing bounce detection and analysis
with Lamson.  It&#8217;s part of the new mailing list example I&#8217;m coding up for the
0.9.6 release which I&#8217;ll be running on a free mailing list site I&#8217;m going 
to release soon.  In this blog post I&#8217;d like to go through the bounce detection
algorithm and get some feedback and samples from people.  So far it works great for
the samples I have, but I want it to be fairly bullet proof.</p></p>

<p>	<p>I just released Lamson 0.9.5 with all the major Unicode refactoring done and working.
This is an important release because 0.9.5 is where I declare that I&#8217;m pushing to a 1.0 
release and the base Lamson <a href="/docs/api/">APIs</a> won&#8217;t change under penalty of death.  In fact they can&#8217;t
change because I&#8217;m using them myself in a few applications.</p></p>

<p>	<p>Since the 0.9.4 release I&#8217;ve rewritten the main part of the decoding parser 
so that it&#8217;s much cleaner and handles more edge conditions.  If there&#8217;s one 
word that defines what makes <span class="caps">MIME</span> horrible it would be &#8220;edge&#8221;.</p></p>

<p>	<p>Lamson 0.9.4 is out and it&#8217;s sporting a completely rewritten and meticulously 
crafted encoding system.  With the new <a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.encoding-module.html">lamson.encoding</a> code Lamson can now decode nearly any nasty horrible encoded spam
or mail you hand it, turn it into pristine nice Python unicode strings, and

the Lamson 1.0 release.  I&#8217;ve been using Lamson to make a few little cute applications
and create one thing for a potential client, and so far I haven&#8217;t had to change much
since 0.9.3.  It&#8217;s great so far and I hope that Lamson 1.0 will be a fun release.</p></p>

<p>	<p>I just finished writing some new documentation on <a href="/docs/deploying_lamson.html">Deploying Lamson and OneShotBlog</a> that
shows you how to install Lamson and all required software into a completely clean Python 2.6 and virtualenv configuration.
The instructions take you from nothing to a running <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> installation that you can 
play with and hack on.  The process of doing Lamson deployments is still a little too rough for me, but these instructions

<p>	<p>This release is the result of me working on my little
<a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> project while tweaking and refining
Lamson as I go.  The end result is 0.9.3 didn&#8217;t have a lot of big code changes,
but all the tiny little changes add up to a very nice release.  The highlights
of this release are more secure server runs, better character encoding handling
for headers, various cleanups in how mail is queued, and fixes for Python 2.6
support.</p></p>

This is the code (plus a few little tweaks) from the sample that is in the <a href="/releases/">Lamson source</a>
running on another server.  It&#8217;s using all the features of Lamson, include the new <a href="/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">Queue Receiver</a>
functionality.  So far it&#8217;s working great considering I&#8217;ve just been hacking on it on the side to try
out the usability of the Lamson <a href="/docs/api/">APIs</a> and not really taken it seriously.</p></p>
