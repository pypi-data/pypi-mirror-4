stop-instances
**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Stops an instance that uses an Amazon EBS volume as its root device.
Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be
quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute
resources are released and you are not billed for hourly instance
usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains,
continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS
volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time.

Note: Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which
  it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data
  stored in RAM.Performing this operation on an instance that uses an
  instance store as its root device returns an error.
