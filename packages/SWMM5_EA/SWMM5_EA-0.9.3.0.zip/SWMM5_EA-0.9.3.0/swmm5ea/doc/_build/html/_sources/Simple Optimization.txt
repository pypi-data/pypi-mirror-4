   Network with five detention storages. 

Figure above shows the drainage network used in this example. It consists of six subcatchments, 
drained to the outlet ``J12`` by a dendritic drainage network. The network has five detention basins
(``J1``, ``J3``, ``J4``, ``J7`` and ``J11``). Each detention storage is ``1.8 m`` deep. 
We want to find the least-cost design that does not cause flooding [1]_.  The cost :math:`c_1` for construction of a detention basin of area ``a`` is simplified as: 

.. math::   

	c_1= 1000 a^{0.8}

We apply the constraint of not allowing for flooding by adding a penalty (cost) for flooding (:math:`c_2`). 
We are not really interested in 
calculating 'cost' of flooding, rather we just want to make it high so that  the optimizer penalizes the 
solutions with flooding. For example we could use: 

.. math::
    c_2= 1.0E12 f
	
Following figures show the Project parameters and swmm input file place-holders used in the example, 
respectively.
