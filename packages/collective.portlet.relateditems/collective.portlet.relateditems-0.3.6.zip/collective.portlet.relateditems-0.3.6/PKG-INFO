        Overview
        --------
        
        This is a simple portlet that displays content similar to the present context.
        Related items are compiled based on the context title and keywords. 
        In case of a folderish context related items are computed based on the contents of the folder and the folder information.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        The relateditems portlet is used in production. See http://www.v2.nl
        
        Options

        - *count*
            This is the number of recent items that will be shown in the portlet.

        - *show_all_types*

        - *portlet_title*
            Title in portlet.
        
        - *only_subject*

        - *display_all_fallback*
