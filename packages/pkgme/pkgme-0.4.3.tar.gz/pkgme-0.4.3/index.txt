``pkgme``
=========

``pkgme`` takes care of packaging your application for distribution on Ubuntu.
Provided that you follow conventions of your language pkgme will generate
working packaging without you having to know any of the inner workings.

Currently ``pkgme`` is looking for "backend" authors who can write the code
that will make ``pkgme`` work for your language.  This doesn't require you to
know everything about packaging, just write code that can tell ``pkgme``
certain facts about a project, such as the version or who wrote it, using
whatever convention makes sense for your language. If you would like to help
then see :doc:`/doc/backends/index`.

Development of ``pkgme`` takes place `at Launchpad.net.`_ There are several
ways to :doc:`contact the developers </contact>` if you wish.
