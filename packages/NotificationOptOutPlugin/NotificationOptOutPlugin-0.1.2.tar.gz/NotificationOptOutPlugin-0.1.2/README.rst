NotificationOptOutPlugin
========================

NotificationOptOutPlugin for Trac which allows users to opt-out from notifications Trac would otherwise send them (on ticket updates and similar) if configured so.

The idea is that if you use a mailing list to which all ticket changes are send users subscribed to it probably do not want duplicate notifications.
