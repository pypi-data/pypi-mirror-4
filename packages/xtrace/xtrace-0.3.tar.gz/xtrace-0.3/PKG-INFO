Description: This module prints `function trace` to stdout from the moment it is called::
        
            import xtrace
            xtrace.start()
            ...
            xtrace.stop()
        
        It is also possible to call `xtrace` as module from the command line::
        
            python -m xtrace <script.py> [param] ...
        
        or use as a standalone script::
        
            python xtrace.py <script.py> [param] ...
        
        
        The output format is that of Xdebug http://xdebug.org/docs/execution_trace
        But frankly, I didn't have time to polish it to be exactly the same. If you
        will find the time and desire to polish it - feel free to send a patch.
        
        This code is released into public domain. Enjoy!
