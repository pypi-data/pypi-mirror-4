count-pending-activity-tasks
****************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the estimated number of activity tasks in the specified task
list. The count returned is an approximation and is not guaranteed to
be exact. If you specify a task list that no activity task was ever
scheduled in then 0 will be returned.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Use a **Condition** element with the "swf:taskList.name" key to
  allow the action to access only certain task lists.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
