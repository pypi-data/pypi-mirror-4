Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        `plone.formwidget.multifile` is a z3c.form-widget which lets users
        upload multiple files, either at once, or in batches using repeated form
        submissions.
        
        Browsers that do not implement the file input "multiple" attribute are
        supported via javascript adding of multiple file inputs. This also works 
        with browsers that do support "multiple", and allows users to add and 
        remove files in bundles. Upload does not occur until the form is saved. 
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using the widget is quiet easy::
        
            >>> from plone.directives import form as directivesform
            >>> from plone.formwidget.multifile import MultiFileFieldWidget
            >>> from plone.namedfile.field import NamedFile
            >>> from zope import schema
            >>> from zope.interface import Interface
            >>> 
            >>> class IMySchema(Interface):
            ...     """My schema interface"""
            ...     
            ...     directivesform.widget(files=MultiFileFieldWidget)
            ...     files = schema.List(title=u'Files',
            ...                         value_type=NamedFile())
        
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        We do not yet support ordering.
        There is no fallback for non-html5, non-javascript browsers. They will
        only be able to upload 1 file at a time.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0a5 (2013-01-21)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed bug on IE: When an file-input is opened via a scripted, forced click()
          event, IE won't let you submit the form.
        * Updated pt_BR translation.
        
        1.0a4 (2012-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Nothing changed yet.
        
        1.0a3 (2012-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Changed the UI so now there's a link to "add files" instead of an standard
          input[type=file] HTML element (which still exists, but is hidden). Users were
          complaining that the old UI was confusing since the textbox of the
          input[type=file] element was always empty. [rafaelbco]
        
        1.0a2 (2012-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Removed integration with jQuery plugin. Instead we use HTML and javascript,
          and when applicable, the "multiple" extension from HTML5 which lets a
          user upload multiple files at once.
          [tmog]
        
        * Fix minor bugs on the new non-flash implementation.
          [rafaelbco]
        
        * Removed dependency on plone.app.drafts.
