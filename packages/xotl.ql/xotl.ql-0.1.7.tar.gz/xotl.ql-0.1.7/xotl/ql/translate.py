'''
The main purposes of this module are two:

- To provide common query/expression translation framework from query objects
  to data store languages.

- To provide a testing bed for queries to retrieve real objects from somewhere
  (in this case the Python's).

def cofind_tokens(*expressions, **kwargs):
    '''
    Coroutine that traverses expression trees an yields every node that matched
    the `accept` predicate. If `accept` is None it defaults to accept only
    :class:`~xotl.ql.interface.ITerm` instances that have a non-None `name`.

    Coroutine behavior:

    You may reintroduce both `expr` and `accept` arguments by sending messages
    to this coroutine. The message may be:

    - A single callable value, which will replace `accept`.

    - A single non callable value, which will be considered *another*
      expression to process. Notice this won't make `cofind_tokens` to stop
      considering all the nodes from previous expressions. However, the
      expression might be explored before other later generated children
      of the previous expressions.

    - A tuple consisting in `(expr, accept)` that will be treated like the
      previous cases.

    - A dict that may have `expr` and `accept` keys.

    The default behavior helps to catch all named ITerm instances in an
    expression. This is useful for finding every "name" in a query, which may
    no appear in the query selection. For instance we, may have a model that
    relates Person objects indirectly via a Relation object::

        >>> from xotl.ql.core import thesefy
        >>> @thesefy('person')
        ... class Person(object):
        ...     pass

        >>> @thesefy('relation')
        ... class Relation(object):
        ...    pass

    Then, for the following query::

        >>> from xotl.ql.core import these
        >>> from itertools import izip
        >>> query = these((person, partner)
        ...               for person, partner in izip(Person, Person)
        ...               for rel in Relation
        ...               if (rel.subject == person) & (rel.obj == partner))

    if we need to find every single named term in the filters of the query,
    we would see that there are seven:

        - `person`, `partner` and `rel` (as given by the `is_instance(...)`
          filters ``@thesefy`` injects)

        - `rel.subject`, `person`, `rel.obj` and `partner` in the explicit
          filter.

        >>> len(list(cofind_tokens(*query.filters)))
        7

def cocreate_plan(query, **kwargs):
    '''
    Builds a :term:`query execution plan` for a given query that fetches
    objects from Python's VM memory.

    This function is meant to be general enough so that other may use it as a
    base for building their :term:`translators <query translator>`.

    It works like this:

    1. First it inspect the tokens and their relations (if a token is the
       parent of another). For instance in the query::

           query = these((parent, child)
                         for parent in this
                         if parent.children & (parent.age > 34)
                         for child in parent.children if child.age < 5)

        The `parent.children` generator tokens is *derived* from the token
        `this`, so there should be a relation between the two.

       .. todo::

          If we allow to have subqueries, it's not clear how to correlate
          tokens. A given token may be a whole query::

              p = these((parent, partner)
                        for parent in this('parent')
                        for partner, _ in subquery((partner, partner.depth())
                                            for partner in this
                                            if contains(partner.related_to,
                                                        parent)))

         Since all examples so far of sub-queries as generators tokens are not
         quite convincing, we won't consider that.
