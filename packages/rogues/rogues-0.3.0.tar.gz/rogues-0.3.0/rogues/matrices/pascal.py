    PASCAL  Pascal matrix.
        p = pascal(n) is the pascal matrix of order n: a symmetric positive
        definite matrix with integer entries taken from Pascal's
        triangle.
        The Pascal matrix is totally positive and its inverse has
        integer entries.  Its eigenvalues occur in reciprocal pairs.
        cond(p) is approximately 16**n/(n*pi) for large n.
        pascal(n,1) is the lower triangular cholesky factor (up to signs
        of columns) of the pascal matrix.   It is involutary (is its own
        inverse).
        pascal(n,2) is a transposed and permuted version of pascal(n,1)
        which is a cube root of the identity.

    Note added in porting: for pascal(10) the properties above seem to be
    verified, especially the eigenvalues being reprocal pairs (all of which
    have the same constant value of one).  det(pascal(n)) is also ~one up to
    and including n=17.  At n=18 things go to hell and this appears to be
    where we step off a cliff
