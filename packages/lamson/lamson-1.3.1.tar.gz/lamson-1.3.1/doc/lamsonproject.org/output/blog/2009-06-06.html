                <h1>Lamson 0.9.3 Is Out And Sexy As Hell</h1>
                	<p>This release is the result of me working on my little
<a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> project while tweaking and refining
Lamson as I go.  The end result is 0.9.3 didn&#8217;t have a lot of big code changes,
but all the tiny little changes add up to a very nice release.  The highlights
of this release are more secure server runs, better character encoding handling
for headers, various cleanups in how mail is queued, and fixes for Python 2.6
support.</p>

	<p>My plan is to keep using this release, improving what is there currently and
only adding minimal features, and just making what is there tighter.  The goal
is to <strong>have a 1.0 release out</strong> once I&#8217;ve used it on
<a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> and the new <a href="/lists/">lamsonproject.org
mailing lists</a> application.</p>

	<h2>Getting It (As Usual)</h2>

	<p>All you need to do to get lamson is read the <a href="/download.html">download instruction</a>
and then go through the <a href="/docs/getting_started.html">getting started</a> to try it out.</p>

	<p>The <strong>docs may be out of date with this release</strong>, but I&#8217;m going through docs tomorrow.</p>

	<h2><span class="caps">NYLUG</span> Python Workshop Tuesday June 09 6:00PM-8:00PM</h2>

	<p>I&#8217;ll be presenting Lamson at the <a href="http://nylug.org/pipermail/nylug-announce/2009-June/000795.html"><span class="caps">NYLUG</span> Python Workshop Tuesday June 09 6:00PM-8:00PM</a>
and helping people get started with it.  If you wanted to try it but didn&#8217;t want
to waste the time then come down and I&#8217;ll hook you up.</p>

	<h2>OneShotBlog Sample Is Live</h2>

	<p>Lamson includes the source to the <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> project
in the <code>examples/osb</code> directory.  You can <a href="/releases/">grab the source tar.gz</a>
and look in there fore the source.  You should also try out the sample site to help
test out Lamson, especially if you use a weird character set (since that&#8217;s the biggest
weakness currently).</p>

	<p>This release of <span class="caps">OSB</span> features a bunch of bug fixes, tons of tests that improve the code
coverage, the ability to comment on a post by sending an email, decent spam filtering
of the comments, ability to flag a comment as spam, and lots of little tweaks.  It 
uses <strong>all</strong> of the features Lamson has right now.</p>

	<p>It still has some work to do, and I want to add the ability to send pictures and source
code (with syntax highlight).</p>

	<h2>The ChangeLog</h2>

	<p>The change log for this release is (with the big ones bold):</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Cleaned up some stray printing and logging.</li>
		<li>Now prints a nicer message if args get a bad argument.</li>
		<li><strong>Managed to get a file object out of the maildir which removes the need to reconvert from a message.</strong></li>
		<li>A few minor test suite tweaks to get coverage on the most recent features.</li>
		<li><strong>Implemented a reorg of how the servers are started so that they can bind port 25 and then drop priv to a safer user.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Initial support for an undeliverable queue and a forwarding handler that you can run in a queue receiver to deliver unhandled mail to the relay.  Needs tests.</strong></li>
		<li>Using the new Router.UNDELIVERABLE_QUEUE feature to have bad mail go to a queue.</li>
		<li>Fixed the queue_command so that it prints what queue it is working with.</li>
		<li>Added a setting for the Router to tell it to dump undeliverable mail to a queue.</li>
		<li><strong>First cut at semi-automated header encoding conversion.</strong></li>
		<li>Initial support for sort-of-automated header decoding/encoding on MailRequest.</li>
		<li>Found a bug in clear_queue which made it not able to clear alternate queues.</li>
		<li>Small changes to fix a non-idiomatic has_key usage.</li>
		<li>Tweaked testing so that it resets the Router state when you do a client.begin() in unit tests.</li>
		<li>Tweaked the boot vs. test logging setup to make it nicer for both situations.</li>
		<li><strong>Since the Router is the primary code loading mechanism, it now uses its own separate logger that you can redirect to stderr to see loading errors during dev.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Created a disconnected set of config testing gear so that it can test without relying on any examples.   Also configures the logger using a config file and cleans up test output.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Added a feature to the routes command to print out how each matching regex will match a given test address.</strong></li>
		<li>Added an exception handler for loading and reloading handlers so that you can see which ones are broke during development.</li>
		<li>Added a -test feature to lamson routes that let&#8217;s you test an address to see what routes it matches.</li>
		<li><strong>Updated for Python 2.6 so the tests will run, not sure why they pass in Python 2.5 actually.</strong></li>
		<li>Modification to the mail parsing so that it forces 'ascii&#8217; encoding to keep email.message_from happy in Python 2.6</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Using The Drop Privilege</h2>

	<p>Lamson can now drop privilege after binding port 25.  Previously it was too difficult
to make the python-daemonize library do it correctly, but after I reorganized some code 
I was able to do the privilege drop manually to implement it.  What this means is you can
run your email server and <strong>stop being root</strong> right after you bind port 25.</p>

	<p>To do this, you&#8217;ll just run your server with:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ sudo lamson start -uid 500 -gid 500
$ cd ..
$ sudo chown -R someuser.someuser yourapp
</pre>

	<p>You technically don&#8217;t have to fix the permissions, but if you use <a href="/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html">queue receivers</a>
then you&#8217;ll need to change the permissions back.  Lamson still creates a few files as root before 
dropping to your given <span class="caps">UID</span> and <span class="caps">GID</span>, but hopefully it will stop doing this soon.</p>

	<p>Obviously, you might want to know what your <span class="caps">UID</span> and <span class="caps">GID</span> is, but it&#8217;s important that you know
what <strong>Python</strong> thinks it is:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
Python 2.5.1 (r251:54863, Jan 13 2009, 10:26:13) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import os
>>> os.getgid()
500
>>> os.getuid()
500
>>> 
</pre>

	<p>There&#8217;s other ways to find it out, but that&#8217;s the Python way.</p>

	<h2>Using lamson routes</h2>

	<p>The <code>lamson routes</code> command has improved a bit so that you can inspect your routing and 
test out an email address to see how it would be sorted.  Here&#8217;s a sample run:</p>

<pre class="code">
osb $ lamson routes -test test.blog@oneshotblog.com
2009-06-07 02:33:31,678 - root - INFO - Database configured to use sqlite:///app/data/main.db URL.
Routing ORDER:  [... lots of regex here ...]
Routing TABLE: 
---
... each regex and what state functions it maps ..
---
'^post-confirm-(?P<id_number>[a-z0-9]+)@(?P<host>oneshotblog\\.com)$':  app.handlers.post.CONFIRMING  
---

TEST address 'test.blog@oneshotblog.com' matches:
  '^(?P<post_name>[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9.]+)@(?P<host>oneshotblog\\.com)$' app.handlers.index.POSTING
  -  {'host': 'oneshotblog.com', 'post_name': 'test.blog'}
  '^(?P<post_name>[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9.]+)@(?P<host>oneshotblog\\.com)$' app.handlers.post.START
  -  {'host': 'oneshotblog.com', 'post_name': 'test.blog'}
  '^(?P<post_name>[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9.]+)@(?P<host>oneshotblog\\.com)$' app.handlers.post.POSTING
  -  {'host': 'oneshotblog.com', 'post_name': 'test.blog'}
osb $ 
</pre>

	<p>If you&#8217;re working with Lamson this is incredibly helpful, because it tells you what
routes you have, what functions they call, and then it&#8217;ll take an email address and
tell you all the routes that match it.</p>

	<p>The output needs to be cleaned up, but for debugging this is nice.</p>

	<h2>The lamson web Command</h2>

	<p>While working on <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog.com</a> I kept having to 
open up the site that it generates, so I just threw a dirt simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server
into Lamson.   Here&#8217;s a sample of running it:</p>

<pre class="code">
~ $ cd projects/lamson/examples/osb/
osb $ lamson web -basedir app/data/
Starting server on 127.0.0.1:8888 out of directory 'app/data/'
localhost - - [06/Jun/2009 12:31:11] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
localhost - - [06/Jun/2009 12:31:11] "GET /styles/reset.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -
localhost - - [06/Jun/2009 12:31:11] "GET /styles/main.css HTTP/1.1" 200 -
localhost - - [06/Jun/2009 12:31:18] code 404, message File not found
</pre>

	<p>It just stays there running and printing to the console, so I just use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/screen.html"><span class="caps">GNU</span> screen</a> and leave it
running in one of the windows.</p>

	<h2>As Usual Test And Report</h2>

	<p>Test this release out, and shoot me feedback.  I&#8217;m hanging on irc.freenode.org
again in the #lamson room, so just stop in if you need help.</p>
