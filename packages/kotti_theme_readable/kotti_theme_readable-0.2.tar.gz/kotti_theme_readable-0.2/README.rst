Setup
=====

To activate the ``kotti_theme_readable`` theme in your Kotti site, you need to
add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
Deploy config.  If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option,
add one.  The line in your ``[app:kotti]`` section could then look like
this::

  kotti.configurators = kotti_theme_readable.kotti_configure

With this, you'll be able to use kotti_theme_readable in your Kotti site.
