        USBlock is a Python script that will lock and unlock your linux box using any 
        old USB storage device as a key.
        
        ** NOTE **
        V0.1 only works on Linux. OS X and Windows will have to wait a little.
        
        Non Python dependencies
        =======================
        
        Linux
        -----
        
        You will need `dbus` and `python-dbus` as well as `hal`. These should all be 
        available via your package manager. See below why `python-dbus` is listed here.
        
        Known Issues
        ============
        
        * I've had some devices not mount on external USB ports (like on a Mac keyboard
        or hub). DBus does not register the device insertion and so USBLock cannot
        lock or unlock your machine. Try a different memory stick or USB port.
        
        * On linux you need dbus installed. `pip install dbus-python` doesn't work, so 
        you may have to install it via your system's package manager or from source.
        
        Thanks for the patches
