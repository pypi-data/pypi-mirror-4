-Integrity Failure during Mutable Downloads
---------------------------------------------------------------
-
-Under certain circumstances, the integrity-verification code of the mutable
-downloader could be bypassed. Clients who receive carefully crafted shares
-(from attackers) will emit incorrect file contents, and the usual
-share-corruption errors would not be raised. This only affects mutable files
-(not immutable), and only affects downloads that use doctored shares. It is
-not persistent: the threat is resolved once you upgrade your client to a
-version without the bug. However, read-modify-write operations (such as
-directory manipulations) performed by vulnerable clients could cause the
-attacker's modifications to be written back out to the mutable file, making
-the corruption permanent.
-
-The attacker's ability to manipulate the file contents is limited. They can
-modify FEC-encoded ciphertext in all but one share. This gives them the
-ability to blindly flip bits in roughly 2/3rds of the file (for the default
-k=3 encoding parameter). Confidentiality remains intact, unless the attacker
-can deduce the file's contents by observing your reactions to corrupted
-downloads.
-
-This bug was introduced in 1.9.0, as part of the MDMF-capable downloader, and
-affects both SDMF and MDMF files. It was not present in 1.8.3.
-
-*how to manage it*
-
-There are three options:
-
-* Upgrade to 1.9.1, which fixes the bug
-* Downgrade to 1.8.3, which does not contain the bug
-* If using 1.9.0, do not trust the contents of mutable files (whether SDMF or
-  MDMF) that the 1.9.0 client emits, and do not modify directories (which
-  could write the corrupted data back into place, making the damage
-  persistent)
