Description: .. -*- restructuredtext -*-
        
        View all Django errors from right within the administration console. 
        
        Erroneous traps Django's in-built exception signal, captures the traceback . which would be the same beautiful exception page that Django displays when debugging is enabled . and saves it to the database so you can view it later.
        
        It's quite similar to ``django-sentry`` from the folks at Disqus but a more lightweight, no-frills, error-logging system for Django. Credits to David Cramer over at Disqus for the initial ``django-db-log`` which is the work this is based upon.
        
        If there's a feature that you're missing and you'd like added, please create an issue on the project page at Github or create the fix yourself and send me a pull request. Adding a few small features here and there are okay but this is in no way aimed to encompass all the functionality of a full-blown error-logging stack like Sentry.
        
        Installation
        ======================
        
        Grab the latest release from PyPI by running::
        
        	pip install django-erroneous
        
        Please note that this requires Django 1.4 to work properly.
        
        Configuration
        ======================
        
        Add ``erroneous`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and run ``syncdb`` (or migrate if you're using South).
        
        There isn't much else than that to get it up and running.
