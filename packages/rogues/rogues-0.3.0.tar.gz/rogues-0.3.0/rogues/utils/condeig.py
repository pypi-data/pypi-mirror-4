    v, lambda, c = condeig(a) Computes condition numbers for the
    eigenvalues of a matrix. The condition numbers are the reciprocals
    of the cosines of the angles between the left and right eigenvectors.
    Inspired by Arno Onken's Octave code for condeig

    When checking against results obtained in Higham & Higham
    a = rogues.frank(6)

    With the this python/numpy condeig we get
