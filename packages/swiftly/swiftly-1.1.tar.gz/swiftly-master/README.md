# Swiftly - A client for Swift

A work in progress. Currently provides a Client class and a command line tool
for common Swift functions. Works both with access as an external, end user to
a Swift cluster and as an internal administrator of a cluster with direct
access to the rings and to all back end servers.

You can read the Sphinx-built documentation at
