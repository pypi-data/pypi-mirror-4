Generating custom keys
======================

This script provides a very basic way to run commands
on the RaspberryPI or any GNU/Linux distribution
based on Debian.

The application includes an encoded Twitter API Key
that simplifies the usage for those users interested only
on remote control.

If you want to enable responses from the commands you must
need generate your own keys and change a couple of lines of code.

Getting an API Key.
=============


1-Go to the page:

    http://dev.twitter.com/

And identify yourself with your twitter account.

2-Find the option "My Applications" under the menu that shows
when you put the mouse over your profile picture.

3-Find the button "Create new Application" and fill the
required fields. You can leave empty the "Callback URL".

4-Read the "Developer Rules Of the Road".

5-Once the application is created, look for "OAuth Settings"
and find "Consumer Key" and "Consumer Secret". Copy those lines
to the file "~/.rpitwit_oauth" ::

    AppName=<Your Twitter application name>
    CONSUMER_KEY=<Your application Consumer Key>
    CONSUMER_SECRET=<Your application Consumer Secret>

6-Run rpitwit with the "--reload-tokens" argument::

    rpitwit --reload-tokens

And follow the authorization wizard again.

7-The new oAuth tokens are going to be saved on the config files.
