Description: Introduction
        ============
        The PloneLDAP product is intended to make it easier to use LDAP connections in
        a Plone website. It builds upon the excellent LDAPMultiPlugins_ and
        LDAPUserFolder_ products which provide the basic LDAP infrastructure. 
        
        For Plone 3.3 or higher, we recommend using `plone.app.ldap`_ for
        having a nicer user interface for using LDAP with Plone.  This uses
        ``PloneLDAP``.
        
        .. _`plone.app.ldap`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.ldap
        
        The extra functionality provided by this product require features
        beyond that are not part of the standard Pluggable Authentication Service,
        which is why they are not included in LDAPMultiPlugins.
        
        .. _LDAPMultiPlugins: http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapmultiplugins
        .. _LDAPUserFolder: http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapuserfolder
        
        PloneLDAP integrates LDAP fully into your Plone site:
        
        * users in an LDAP database can be used as normal users in Plone. You
          can search for them, assign roles to them, create them and remove them.
        
        * groups in an LDAP database can be used as normal groups in Plone. You
          can view them, manage group members, create new groups and remove them.
          LDAP groups can only have LDAP users as members. LDAP users can be
          group members of non-LDAP groups.
        
        * member properties for LDAP users need not be stored completely in the
          LDAP database: you can mix LDAP and ZODB-stored properties.
        
        
        Active Directory
        ================
        
        Please note that if you are using Active Directory (AD) all access is
        read-only.  For example, you cannot add AD users to AD groups.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Plone 3.0 or later
        * python-ldap_
        * LDAPUserFolder 2.8 or later
        * LDAPMultiPlugins 1.5 or later
        
        .. _python-ldap: http://python-ldap.sourceforge.net/
        
        Products.PloneLDAP depends on LDAPMultiPlugins and LDAPUserFolder, so they
        will be installed automatically.
        
        For the record, it has been tested with these most recent versions::
        
          Plone = 4.2.2
          Products.LDAPMultiPlugins = 1.14
          Products.LDAPUserFolder = 2.24
          dataflake.fakeldap = 1.1
          python-ldap = 2.4.10
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        First you need to install the python-ldap package. Once that has been
        installed you need to add the Products.PloneLDAP egg to your Plone instance.
        If you use buildout just add ``Products.PloneLDAP`` to the list of required
        eggs. Otherwise you will need to use ``easy_install``. See the documentation
        on plone.org for more information on installing third party packages.
        
          **Do not install LDAPUserFolder from the Plone site setup screen. This
          will break your Plone site.**
        
        PloneLDAP provides PAS plugins that you can use to get your site talking to
        LDAP or Active Directory. To install them go the acl_users folder in your
        site. Select the right plugin from the dropdown menu in the top right: use
        'Plone LDAP Plugin' if you want to connect to a standard LDAP server or
        'Plone Active Directory Plugin' if you want to connect to a Microsoft Active
        Directory server. 
        
        After selecting the plugin type you will see a screen where you need to
        submit the configuration information. Consult your LDAP or AD administrator
        if you are not sure what the correct information is.
        
        After creating the plugin it has to be activated. To do this go to the
        plugin in the ZMI and go to the 'navigate' tab, select all plugin types
        and click on the 'Update' button.
        
        As a final change you will need to reorder the plugin order. Reodering
        can be done by clicking on the name of a plugin type, selecting a plugin
        in the 'Active Plugins' list and using the up and down arrows to change
        the ordering. The required ordering changes are:
        
        * Properties: LDAP has to be the top plugin
        * Group_Management: LDAP should be the top plugin if you want to
          create groups in the LDAP database
        * User_Adder: has to be the top plugin if you want new users to be
          created in LDAP
        * User_Management: LDAP has to be the top plugin
        
        
        LDAP caveats
        ============
        
        LDAPUserFolder
        --------------
        Inside the PloneLDAP PAS plugin you will see another acl_users user folder.
        This is a ''LDAPUserFolder'' instance, which is used to manage the low-level
        communication with the LDAP server. By updating its properties you can
        reconfigure your LDAP connection.
        
        The LDAPUserFolder instance is only used to communicate with the LDAP server.
        Its user and group management facilities are not used. You can use it to
        quickly test if your LDAP connection is correctly configured.
        
        If you make any changes in users or groups through the LDAPUserFolder ZMI
        interfaces these will be applied to the LDAP server but the caches used
        by the PloneLDAP plugin will not be invalidated correctly. This may lead
        to unexpected results and it is strongly recommended to only use the Plone
        interface to update users and groups.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.2 (2012-11-30)
        ----------------
        
        * Only the LDAP plugin implements IGroupManagement, not the
          ActiveDirectory plugin.  This is for adding, removing and editing
          groups.
        
        * Code moved to https://github.com/collective/Products.PloneLDAP
        
        * Let only the LDAP multi plugin implement the IGroupCapability
          interface (add a user to a group or remove a user from a group).
          Previously the AD multi plugin claimed to implement this too, but it
          lacked the required methods, so this could lead to tracebacks.  We
          could instead add those methods via the mixin class, but but this
          gave other tracebacks (in removePrincipalFromGroup) when I tried it
          in one AD setup.
        
        * Fix setProperties to split value into lines if lines property
          receives a string instead of an iterable.
        
        * When creating an Active Directory plugin configure LDAPUserFolder
          to ignore disabled or non-user accounts. This requires 
          Products.LDAPUserFolder 2.11 or later.
        
        
        1.1 (2008-06-10)
        ----------------
        
        * Switch license to ZPL.
        
        * Depend on the Products.LDAPMultiPlugins and Products.LDAPUserFolder.
        
        * Switch to egg-only releases from now on.
        
        
        1.0
        ---
        
        * Hide LDAPUserFolder from the list of Add-On Products since installing it
          will kill your Plone site. Plone 3.0 only.
        
        * Fix incorrect security declaration for doDeleteUser
        
        
        1.0rc3
        ------
        
        * Fix getGroupMembers to return user ids instead of login names for group
          members. This broke group membership listing in environments where userid
          and login name differ (for example AD environments). Thanks to Netcentric
          for discovering this and helping me fix it.
        
        * Add some protection against invalid (None) results of group related
          searches. 
        
        * Add more information about the capabilities and caveats of LDAP use in Plone.
        
        
        1.0rc2
        ------
        
        * Improve the documentation.
        
        * Add missing cache invalidation for role management and user deletion.
        
        * Fix updating of single-valued member properties.
        
        * Use a different method to get the containing LDAPUserFolder. This allows
          use of PloneLDAP outside of a CMF site.
        
        
        1.0rc1
        ------
        
        * Fix setting of object classes when creating a new plugin instance.
        
        * Fix member property sheets: RAM caching does not like it when you try 
          to store non-pickleable data.
