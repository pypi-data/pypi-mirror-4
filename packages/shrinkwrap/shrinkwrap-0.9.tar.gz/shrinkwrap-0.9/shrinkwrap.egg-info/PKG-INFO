Description: shrinkwrap: Python packaging for everything
        ===========================================
        
        Shrinkwrap provides tools to create lightweight Python package
        wrappers around non-Python software, and to install such software from
        project-specific repositories using virtualenv and pip.
        
        A shrinkwrap package is a minimal python package that downloads,
        compiles and installs software to the virtualenv base directory.  The
        shrinkwrap package behaves just like a regular python package, so both
        shrinkwrap and non-shrinkwrap packages can be dependencies of each
        other.  We find that this greatly simplifies deployment of Python
        packages that depend on compiled libraries *without* requiring the use
        of system-wide packaging tools, like apt or yum.  Shrinkwrap is
        **not** an API wrapper generator like `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`_,
        but does make it easier to install C libraries into a virtualenv
        before installing a separate Python wrapper around its API.
