# Legend:
# --- = A new release
#   + = Added a feature (in a backwards compatible way)
#   ! = Changed something significant, or removed a feature
#   * = Fixed a bug, or made a minor improvement

--- 0.500 (2013-02-05 20:25))

  + Add match_signature methods to DKIMAuthenticationResult and DomainKeys-
    AuthenticationResult classes implementing matching against a DKIM/DK
    signature by d=, and, in the case of the authres.dkim_b module, b= (per
    RFC 6008, section 4).

--- 0.402 (2012-06-22 05:26)

  * Fix setup.py to install authres/tests (LP: #1007909)
  + Add AuthenticationResultsHeader.header_value() method.
  ! Moved doctest initiation from __init__.py to __main__.py so tests only run
    when the module is called as the main program

--- 0.401 (2012-04-13 20:27)
  * Fix MANIFEST.in to include correct files

--- 0.4 (2012-04-13 20:02)

  * Update note on use of fail instead of hardfail for SPF results now that
    the IANA registry has been updated and RFC 6577 published
  * Fix doctests to run when authres is imported
  ! No longer will run as main, which wasn't doing anything anyway
  * Split doctests and move most to authres/tests to make the docstrings
    bearable
  ! Changed pypi classifier for development status to production/stable

--- 0.399 (2012-02-09 06:15)

  + Added support for comments on headers where no authentication is performed
  + Added support in DKIMAuthenticationResults class for RFC 6008
    cryptographic identification header (header.b)
  + Added support for RFC 5617 DKIM ADSP authentication method in new
    DKIMADSPAuthenticationResult class
  + Added support for RFC 6212 Vouch By Reference (VBR) authentication method
    in new VBRAuthenticationResult class

--- 0.3 (2012-01-07 05:24)

  + Added support for comments on most header elements to object constructors.
    Comments are correctly stringified from constructed objects, however
    conversely, are not currently parsed from strings.
  ! The authres function and most object constructor signatures have changed in
    terms of argument order to allow for new comment arguments.  Using named
    arguments is recommended.
  * Added additional doctests from RFC 5451 examples

--- 0.2 (2011-08-10 16:50)

  ! Reworked API from scratch to be more properly OO, extendable, and
    maintainable
  + Parse authentication results headers
  ! Started rework of doctests to match new API and be more readable
  + Specific subclasses for creating and parsing dkim, domainKeys, spf,
    senderid, iprev, and smtp auth authentication methods

--- 0.1 (2011-03-14 18:00)

  + Initial release
  + Create authentication results headers
