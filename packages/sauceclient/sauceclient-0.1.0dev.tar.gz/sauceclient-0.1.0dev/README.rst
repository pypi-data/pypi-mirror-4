about sauceclient
-----------------

``sauceclient`` is a Python client library, used for accessing the Sauce Labs
API to retrieve and update information about resources such as:

* Information
* Jobs
* Provisioning
* Usage

``sauceclient`` is *not* for running your tests on Sauce Labs'
service.  (That is done via Selenium WebDriver).
