def dramadah(n, k=1):
    """
    dramadah  a (0,1) matrix whose inverse has large integer entries.
          An anti-hadamard matrix a is a matrix with elements 0 or 1 for
          which mu(a) := norm(inv(a),'fro') is maximal.
          a = dramadah(n, k) is an n-by-n (0,1) matrix for which mu(a) is
          relatively large, although not necessarily maximal.
          Available types (the default is k = 1):
          k = 1: a is toeplitz, with abs(det(a)) = 1, and mu(a) > c(1.75)^n,
                 where c is a constant.
          k = 2: a is upper triangular and toeplitz.
          the inverses of both types have integer entries.

          Another interesting (0,1) matrix:
          K = 3: A has maximal determinant among (0,1) lower Hessenberg
          matrices: det(A) = the n'th Fibonacci number.  A is Toeplitz.
          The eigenvalues have an interesting distribution in the complex
          plane.
