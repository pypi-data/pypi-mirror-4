Description: GifTiffLoader is a module to automatically load Tiff and Gif files as
        numpy arrays using PIL.
        
        Specifically it is designed to deal with 8-bit
        and 16-bit images typically used as the standard formats for microscope
        images.  It is also designed to deal with image stacks (Animated Gifs and
        Multi-page Tiffs) and image sequences (both 3D and 4D sequences).
        
        GifTiffLoader relies on two other modules, FilenameSort and cmpGen.
        
        Sponsored by the NSF, NIH, and HFSP through the Shane Hutson Laboratory, part of
        Vanderbilt Institute of Integrative Biosystems Research (VIIBRE).
