Changelog

1.8.0 (2012-08-22)
------------------

* Updated modification date in Sitemaps for folderish objects which have
  default pages.
  Sitemap types have their own index (sitemap_date) 
  which helps to generate Sitemaps without default pages. 
  Index contains the last modification date from this object or  
  from default page. As а result you will not see default pages 
  in sitemap types.
