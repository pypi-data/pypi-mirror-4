Description: ============================
        Python bindings for UCG API.
        ============================
        
        `UCG <http://www.generateuniquecontent.com/index.php>`_ is an online
        service for spinning text (synonym substitution)
        that creates unique version(s) of existing text.
        This package provides a way to easily interact with
        `UCG API <http://www.generateuniquecontent.com/api.php>`_.
        Usage requires an API subscription,
        `get it here <http://www.generateuniquecontent.com/signup.php>`_.
        
        * `Source code @ GitHub <https://github.com/niteoweb/ucg>`_
        
        
        Install within virtualenv
        =========================
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            $ virtualenv foo
            $ cd foo
            $ git clone https://github.com/niteoweb/ucg
            $ bin/pip install ucg/
        
            # running tests:
            $ bin/pip install unittest2 mock
            $ bin/python -m unittest discover -s ucg/src/ucg/tests
        
        
        Buildout
        ========
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/niteoweb/ucg
            $ virtualenv --no-site-packages ./ucg/
            $ cd ucg
            $ bin/python bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
        
            # running tests and check code for imperfections
            $ ./pre-commit-hook.sh
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        .. sourcecode:: python
        
            >>> from ucg import UCG
            >>> u = UCG("your@email.xyz", "yourapikey")
            >>> u.login()
            >>> print u.unique_variation(u"Some test text whi훾 is f체.")
            u"Some trial cookie whi훾 is f체."
            >>> u.logout()
