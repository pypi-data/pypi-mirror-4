        ======================
        
        
        Yes, this is **under early development** and everything, everything, may
        still change.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        1. Add ``sphinxcontrib_robotdoc`` into your configuration (``conf.py``)::
        
            extensions = [
                "sphinxcontrib_robotdoc",
            ]
        
        2. Include test suites and keywords in your documentation::
        
            .. robot_tests:: Test title or RegExp.*
               :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
               :tags: bugs, new
        
            .. robot_keywords::
               :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt

        ------------------
        
        - Refactored to use Docutils' nested_parse instead of publish_string (no more

        0.3.1 (2012-10-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Refactored to parse test/keyword documentation with
          docutils.core.publish_string (and append them as raw nodes) instead of trying
          to parse them into sphinx document tree.
