        On Feb 13th I joined the PyLadies folks (along with a friend, `@btanaka
        <https://twitter.com/btanaka>`_) to learn about how to make an IRC bot.
        
        There was no formal presentation, but it was a great opportunity to get
        together with friends and hack. The notes from the event can be found `here
        <http://bit.ly/pyladychat>`_, with relevant code found at `this GitHub repo
        <https://github.com/trustrachel/pyladies-chatbot>`_.
        
        I can understand why `Rachel <http://trustrachel.com/>`_ would have started
        with a repository that wouldn't have required a single sudo or pip command:
        `K.I.S.S <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle>`_ . There is overhead
        associated with teaching pip/virtualenv/etc. when people don't know what that
        is.
        
        After perusing the code in that repo, however, I thought that there had to be
        a simpler way. Back in December the question of making an IRC bot came up in
        the `BayPIGgies <http://www.baypiggies.net/>`_ mailing list, and Guido hisself
        answered `with one word: Twisted
        <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/baypiggies/2012-December/008715.html>`_.
        
        I thought I ought to look at what it would take, and turns out that it isn't
        much; I made this repo/package so that people could grab the source, run
        setup.py develop, and hack/execute to their heart's content. 
        
        I hope someone finds it useful.
        
        
        installation
        ============
        
        If you're going to hack, clone this repo:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            hg clone https://bitbucket.org/smcquay/ircbot
            cd ircbot
            python setup.py develop
        
        And then continue to add code to ircbot.IRCBot.privmsg.
        
        If you're not going to hack and just want a simple echo server:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install ircbot
        
        
        execution
        =========
        
        Once you've installed the bot, you can invoke it as such:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ircbot -p 6668 -n echobot python utah-python
        
        or consult ircbot -h.
