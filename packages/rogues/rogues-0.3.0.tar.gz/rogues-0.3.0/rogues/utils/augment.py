    AUGMENT  Augmented system matrix.
         AUGMENT(A, ALPHA) is the square matrix
         [alpha*eye(m) a; a' zeros(n)] of dimension m+n, where a is m-by-n.
         It is the symmetric and indefinite coefficient matrix of the
         augmented system associated with a least squares problem
         minimize NORM(A*x-b).  alpha defaults to 1.
         Special case: if "a" is a scalar, n say, then augment(a) is the
                       same as AUGMENT(RANDN(p,q)) where n = p+q and
                       p = ROUND(n/2), that is, a random augmented matrix
                       of dimension n is produced.
         The eigenvalues of AUGMENT(A) are given in terms of the singular
         values s(i) of A (where m>n) by
                  1/2 +/- SQRT( s(i)^2 + 1/4 ),  i=1:n  (2n eigenvalues),
                  1,  (m-n eigenvalues).
         If m < n then the first expression provides 2m eigenvalues and the
         remaining n-m eigenvalues are zero.
