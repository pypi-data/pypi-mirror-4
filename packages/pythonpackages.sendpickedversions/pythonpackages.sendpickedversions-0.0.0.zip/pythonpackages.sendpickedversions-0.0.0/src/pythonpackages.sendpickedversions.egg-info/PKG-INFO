Description: .. Note::
        
            This is a fork of buildout.sendpickedversions made exclusively for use with pythonpackages.com. It configures buildoutname to hostname + dirname dynamically, to facilitate aggregation of a large number of buildouts. If there is general interest, this change may be included in future versions of buildout.sendpickedversions.
        
        buildout.sendpickedversions
        ===========================
        
        This package is based on buildout.dumppickedversions_ and its purpose is to
        gather the package name and version information from buildout. The main
        difference with buildout.dumppickedversions_ is that instead of displaying
        picked versions, or dumping everything to a file, we'll send package information
        to a predefined URL.
        
        Original use case is that there is Whiskers_ server on the other end which stores
        the data. There's nothing special about the data, so other end can just as well
        be anything that can handle json.
        
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        To use buildout.sendpickedversions with buildout your buildout.cfg should have
        buildout.sendpickedversions in you extensions-line and following fields
        configured:
        
        buildoutname
            This is the name of the buildout. Whiskers_ uses this information to create
            new buildout object with the package data. If name is not set we use default
            'dummy_buildout' as a name.
        
        whiskers-url
            This is the url to whiskers server. As stated above, you can use here
            anything that can just eat the json-data we're sending. If you leave this
            empty or don't set at all buildout.sendpickedversions just displays the data
            dict.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Here's small example configuration. ::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions = buildout.sendpickedversions
            buildoutname = test
            whiskers-url = http://localhost:6543/buildouts/add
        
            parts = nose
        
            [nose]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs = nose
        
        Above example configuration assumes you have Whiskers_ server running locally on
        port 6543. If you run buildout it will install nose normally to your buildout
        environment and after everything is ready it will try to send following data in
        json-format to localhost:6543/buildouts/add URL: ::
        
            {"buildoutname": "test",
             "packages": [
                {"version": "0.6.24", "name": "distribute"},
                {"version": "1.18", "name": "mr.developer"},
                {"version": "1.1.2", "name": "nose"},
                {"required_by": ["mr.developer 1.18"], "version": "1.5.2", "name": "zc.buildout"},
                {"version": "1.3.2", "name": "zc.recipe.egg"}
              ]
            }
        
        Thanks
        ------
        
        Code is mainly based to Mustapha Benali's buildout.dumppickedversions_. This
        buildout extension has probably saved thousands of buildouts from nasty version
        conflicts or total havoc. Huge thanks!

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0a1 (unreleased)
        ------------------
        
        - Returns a lots of new information about buildout including whole buildout
          section (with defaults and computed values as well).
        - Returns absolutely all package requirements with versions numbers (both
          picked version and fuzzy version requirement like zope.interface >= 3.8).
        - Picks buildout name from directory name - no need to specify buildoutname
          to buildout config anymore (though you still can if you want to).
        
        0.3 (2012-10-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Performance optimizations (ported from zc.buildout).
        
        0.2 (2011-10-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Sends data urlencoded.
        
        0.1 (2011-10-16)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial import
