.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new cluster. To create the cluster in virtual private cloud (VPC), you
must provide cluster subnet group name. If you don\(aqt provide a cluster subnet
group name or the cluster security group parameter, Amazon Redshift creates a
non\-VPC cluster, it associates the default cluster security group with the
cluster. .

the \fB\-\-cluster\-type\fP parameter is specified as \fBmulti\-node\fP .
.sp
For information about determining how many nodes you need, go to \fI\%Working with
Clusters\fP in the \fIAmazon Redshift Management Guide\fP .

.TP
.B \fB\-\-availability\-zone\fP  (string)
The EC2 Availability Zone (AZ) in which you want to provision the cluster. For
example, if you have several EC2 instances running in a specific Availability
Zone, then you might want the cluster to be provisioned in the same zone in
order to decrease network latency.
.sp
Default: A random, system\-chosen Availability Zone in the region that is
specified by the endpoint.
.sp
Example: \fBus\-east\-1d\fP
.sp
Constraint: The specified Availability Zone must be in the same region as the
current endpoint.

.TP
.B \fB\-\-cluster\-parameter\-group\-name\fP  (string)
The name of the parameter group to be associated with this cluster.

Default: The default cluster parameter group. For information about the
default parameter group, go to \fI\%Working with Amazon Redshift Parameter Groups\fP

The type of the cluster. When cluster type is specified as
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsingle\-node\fP , the \fB\-\-number\-of\-nodes\fP parameter is not required.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmulti\-node\fP , the \fB\-\-number\-of\-nodes\fP parameter is required.

.sp
Valid Values: \fBmulti\-node\fP | \fBsingle\-node\fP
.sp
Default: \fBmulti\-node\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vpc\-security\-group\-ids\fP  (list of string)
A list of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups to be associated with
the cluster.

automatically apply upgrades during the maintenance window to the engine that
is running on your cluster.
.sp
