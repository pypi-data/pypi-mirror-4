    GE     Gaussian elimination without pivoting.
       [l, u, rho] = ge(a) computes the factorization a = l*u,
       where L is unit lower triangular and U is upper triangular.
       RHO is the growth factor.
       By itself, ge(a) returns the final reduced matrix from the
       elimination containing both L and U.

       --------------------------------------------
       There are obviously more efficient routines in numpy / scipy
       but this routine is intended for testing numerical properties,
       ie it can be used in the direct search method adsmax for finding
       a matrix that maximizes the value of rho. See the following very
       readable and fun paper that is available from Prof. Higham's web
       site:
