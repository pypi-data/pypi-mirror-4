Description: Apache buildout recipe
        ======================
        
        This package provides buildout_ recipes for the configuration of apache.  This
        has a number of features that we have found useful in production, such as
        support for long CA chains, htpasswd authentication protection and the support
        for optional templates provided with the buildout.
        
        We use the system apache, so this recipe will not install apache for you.  If
        you wish to install apache, use `zc.recipe.cmmi`_ perhaps.

        Mandatory Parameters
        --------------------
        
        interface
            The IP address of the interface on which to listen
        sitename
            The name of the site, used to identify the correct virtual host
        serveradmin
            The email address of the administrator of the server
        proxyport
            The port to which requests are forwarded
        
        Optional Parameters
        -------------------
        
        realm
            The name of the HTTP Authentication realm, if you wish to password protect this site
        passwdfile
            The filename of the htpasswd file to secure the realm, defaults to "passwd" in the part directory
        username
            The username used in the htpasswd file
        allowpurge
            The IP address of a server that is permitted to send PURGE requests to this server
        portal
            The name of the portal object in the zope server, defaults to "portal"
        template
            The filename of the template file to use, if you do not wish to use the default
        configfile
            The name of the config file written by the recipe, defaults to "apache.cfg" in the part directory
        ssl
            Should ssl be on or off. By default this isn't needed, setting the ssl options is enough
            to turn it on. Useful to force SSL off, even if your base buildout set defaults.
        sslca
            A list of full pathnames to certificate authority certificate files
        sslcert
            The full pathname of the ssl certificate, if required

        rewrites
            A list source;destination;flags that gets expanded to 'RewriteRule source destination [flags]'
        auto-www
            If true, the recipe will have a Redirect for www.${sitename}. If your sitename already has a www prefix, the alias will be sitename with the prefix trimmed.
        logdir
            Where to store apache logs (Default: /var/log/apache2)
        logformat
            What apache logformat to use (Default: combined)
        protected
            A list of locations to set a basic auth password on, should be a list of lines of the format: <URI>:<realm>:<username>:<password>
        enhanced-privacy
            Set to true to stop it logging IP addresses (Default: IP addresses are logged)
        
        Domain-level Redirects
        ======================
        
        When using isotoma.recipe.apache:redirect you can listen on an interface and redirect any hits for a domain to any url.
        
        
        Mandatory Paramaters
        --------------------
        
        interface

        redirects
            A list of domain;url pairs, seperated by ';'. E.g. www.isotoma.com;http://www.isotoma.com/foo
