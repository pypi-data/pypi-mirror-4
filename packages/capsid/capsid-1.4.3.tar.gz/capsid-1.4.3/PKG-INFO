Description: CaPSID
        ========
        **CaPSID** (Computational Pathogen Sequence IDentification) is a comprehensive
        open source platform which integrates a high-performance computational pipeline
        for pathogen sequence identification and characterization in human genomes and
        transcriptomes together with a scalable results database and a user-friendly
        web-based software application for managing, querying and visualizing results.
