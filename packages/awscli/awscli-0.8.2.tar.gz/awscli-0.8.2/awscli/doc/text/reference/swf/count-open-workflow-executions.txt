count-open-workflow-executions
******************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the number of open workflow executions within the given
--domain that meet the specified filtering criteria.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Constrain the following parameters by using a "Condition" element
  with the appropriate keys.

* "tag" : String constraint. The key is "swf:tagFilter.tag" .

* "typeFilter.name" : String constraint. String constraint. The key is
  "swf:typeFilter.name" .

* "typeFilter.version" : String constraint. String constraint. The key
  is "swf:typeFilter.version" .

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf count-open-workflow-executions
     --domain <value>
     --start-time-filter <value>
     [--execution-filter <value>]
     [--type-filter <value>]
     [--tag-filter <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The name of the --domain containing the workflow executions to
   count.

"--start-time-filter"  (structure)
   Specifies the start time criteria that workflow executions must
   meet in order to be counted.

   "oldest_date"  (timestamp)

   "latest_date"  (timestamp)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "oldest_date": timestamp,
        "latest_date": timestamp
      }


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--execution-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions matching the "WorkflowId" in
   the filter are counted.

   Note: "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter" and "--tag-filter" are
     mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a
     request.

   "workflow_id"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "workflow_id": "string"
      }

"--type-filter"  (structure)
   Specifies the type of the workflow executions to be counted.

   Note: "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter" and "--tag-filter" are
     mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a
     request.

   "version"  (string)

   "name"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "version": "string",
        "name": "string"
      }

"--tag-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only executions that have a tag that matches the
   filter are counted.

   Note: "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter" and "--tag-filter" are
     mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a
     request.

   "tag"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "tag": "string"
