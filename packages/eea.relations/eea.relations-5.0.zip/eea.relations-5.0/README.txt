Introduction
============

Once installed from "Add-ons", the package will add an utility
called "Possible relations" under control panel.


Main features
=============

Main goal of EEA Relations is to be an alternative to the default Plone
related item widget.

EEA Relations features:

  1. Define/restrict what kind of content types a certain content can relate to
  2. Set restrictions on possible relations (e.g. relations can be made
     only with published content)
  3. You can define easy to use faceted searches (using EEA Faceted navigation)
     on the relate items popup
  4. Nice visual diagram showning all the relations and restrictions you defined
     (Control pane -> Possible relations)

Installation
============

zc.buildout
-----------
If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Update your buildout.cfg file:

  * Add ``eea.relations`` to the list of eggs to install
  * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug

  ::

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
      ...
      eea.relations

    zcml =
      ...
      eea.relations

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

  $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
