Carcade is the static site generator written in Python. The main features are:

* Jinja2 templates
* Static assets management
* Easy localization
* And, unlike many other static site generators,
  Carcade doesn't make any assumptions about the site structure.

Documentation available on `Read the Docs`_.

There are also:

* `Repository containing examples`_;
* `pycon.ru`_ built on Carcade (see it's `GitHub repo`_).
