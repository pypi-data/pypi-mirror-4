associate-route-table
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Associates a subnet with a route table. The subnet and route table
must be in the same VPC. This association causes traffic originating
from the subnet to be routed according to the routes in the route
table. The action returns an association ID, which you need if you
want to disassociate the route table from the subnet later. A route
table can be associated with multiple subnets.

For more information about route tables, go to Route Tables in the
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.
