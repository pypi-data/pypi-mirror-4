update-pipeline-status
**********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

To pause or reactivate a pipeline, so the pipeline stops or restarts
processing jobs, update the status for the pipeline. Send a POST
request to the "/2012-09-25/pipelines/*[pipelineId]* /status"
resource.

Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want to cancel one or
more jobs. You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started
processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you submitted the
jobs, you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want
to cancel, and to send a  cancel-job request.
