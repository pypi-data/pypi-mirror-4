What is ztfy.thesaurus ?
========================

ztfy.thesaurus is a quite small package used to handle content's indexation
through the help of a structured and controlled vocabulary's thesaurus, which is
like a big hierarchic dictionary of terms linked together.

Several XML standards have emerged to handle such thesauri ; this package is mainly based
on a custom format but you can import and export thesaurus in SKOS/RDF format.
