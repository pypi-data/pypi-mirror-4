release-address
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The release-address operation releases an elastic IP address
associated with your account.

Note: Releasing an IP address automatically disassociates it from any
  instance with which it is associated. For more information, see
  DisassociateAddress.

Warning: After releasing an elastic IP address, it is released to the IP
  address pool and might no longer be available to your account. Make
  sure to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that
  communicate with the address.If you run this operation on an elastic
  IP address that is already released, the address might be assigned
  to another account which will cause Amazon EC2 to return an error.
