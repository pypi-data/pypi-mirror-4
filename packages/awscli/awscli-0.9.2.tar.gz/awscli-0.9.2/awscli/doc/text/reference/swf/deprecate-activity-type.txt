deprecate-activity-type
***********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deprecates the specified *activity type* . After an activity type has
been deprecated, you cannot create new tasks of that activity type.
Tasks of this type that were scheduled before the type was deprecated
will continue to run.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Constrain the following parameters by using a "Condition" element
  with the appropriate keys.

* "activityType.name" : String constraint. The key is
  "swf:activityType.name" .

* "activityType.version" : String constraint. The key is
  "swf:activityType.version" .

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
