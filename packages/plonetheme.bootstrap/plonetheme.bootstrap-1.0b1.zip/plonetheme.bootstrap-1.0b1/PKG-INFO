Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plonetheme.bootstrap integrates the bootstrap css/js framework
        into plone. You can checkout the framework at http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap
        
        It overrides some templates and uses javascript to transform
        some markup in order for it to work correctly.
        
        It's not perfect, but it's close.
        
        Dependencies
        ==============
        
        Latest Twitter Bootstrap javascript required jQuery 1.7.x, you can install
        it in Plone pinning plone.app.jquery in your buildout to version 1.7.1.1
        as follows::
        
         [versions]
         ...
         plone.app.jquery = 1.7.1.1
         ...
        
        
        Documentation
        ===============
        
        This product is based in Twitter Bootstrap version 2.2.1 and it redistributes it
        according to its `License terms`_.
        
        This product adds both the basic CSS file and also the Responsive one to have
        your site mobile-enabled from the start.
        
        The generated markup is based on 'fluid CSS' and it contains a 12 column grid.
        
        The basic HTML markup is a mix of `plonetheme.sunburst`_ and Twitter Bootstrap
        and it uses the same approach of constructing the columns with as Sunburst:
        a simple view that returns the classes needed to have the correct column widths.
        
        If you want to change those widths, just override the view.
        
        This product is intended to be used in two scenarios:
        
         - As a theme from Plone
         - As a base theme to build Plone themes for your site following 'old practices'
        
        Some designers prefer to work following the old best-practices instead of using
        the Diazo-way-of-theming, this product is for them. You can create a theme package
        (check `templer skeleton generator`_), and base your them on this one.
        
        If you have any problem using this product or find any bug, please report it
        using the `GitHub issue tracker`_.
