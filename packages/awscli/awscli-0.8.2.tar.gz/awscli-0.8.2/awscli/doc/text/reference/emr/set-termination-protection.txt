set-termination-protection
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

set-termination-protection locks a job flow so the Amazon EC2
instances in the cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an
API call, or in the event of a job-flow error. The cluster still
terminates upon successful completion of the job flow. Calling set-
termination-protection on a job flow is analogous to calling the
Amazon EC2 DisableAPITermination API on all of the EC2 instances in a
cluster.

set-termination-protection is used to prevent accidental termination
of a job flow and to ensure that in the event of an error, the
instances will persist so you can recover any data stored in their
ephemeral instance storage.

To terminate a job flow that has been locked by setting set-
termination-protection to "true" , you must first unlock the job flow
by a subsequent call to set-termination-protection in which you set
the value to "false" .

For more information, go to Protecting a Job Flow from Termination in
the *Amazon Elastic MapReduce Developer's Guide.*

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--termination-protected"  | "--no-termination-protected"  (boolean)

   due to API calls, user intervention, or job-flow error.

"--job-flow-ids"  (list of string)
   A list of strings that uniquely identify the job flows to protect.
   This identifier is returned by  run-job-flow and can also be
   obtained from describe-job-flows .
