            <p>
               This product is an implementation of OAI-PMH metadata interchange protocol. It is based on Zope views that
               permits the application of Software Engineering to Plone Products. In this case we have decided to develop a simple
               class diagram because it's very simple.
            </p>
            <p>
               The objective for this Plone package is to create an OAI interface in Plone for harvesters and
                distributed searches.  
            </p>
            <a name="diagram"><h2>Class Diagram</h2></a>
               This is the class diagram:<br>

            <td style="text-align: center">

            <a name="install"><h2>Install</h2></a>
						   <p>collective.oaiintercom can be installed via buildout. Add the following to your buildout.cfg:<br />
<pre>[buildout]
...
eggs = 
    collective.oaiintercom

...

[instance]
...
zcml =
    collective.oaiintercom
</pre>		

And rerun buildout.
<pre>$ ./bin/buildout</pre>
					<p>Now you may either install OAI intercom as an extension profile, or via the QuickInstaller.</p>
           <p>To access the OAI interface, visit http://HOST:PORT/Plone/oai.</p>
					<p> If you want to test it use <a href="http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/">http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/</a> or use greenstone software to harvest the repository.</p>

               <p>
               There are multiple ways to use this product. One of them is use a repository harvester like <a href="http://www.greenstone.org">Greenstone Digital Library Software</a>. 
							It is an application written in Java to make library collections. You can use it to create local metadata repositories of your Plone content.
               </p>
               <p>
               Another way to access the OAI-PMH results is via the web browser, but OAI is not designed for human reading. After installing the package, you can visit: http://localhost/Plone/oai and the following view will render:
               <img src="images/response1.png" /><br />
               In order to see results, you must provide verbs.
               </p>

               <a name="verbs"><h2>Verbs</h2></a>  
               <h3>Identify</h3>
               <p>This verb is used to get information about the server. It can be used to identify the repository in an index.
               It doesn't takes any parameters ::<br />http://localhost:PORT/Plone/oai?verb=Identify

               <h3>ListMetadataFormats</h3>
               <p>This verb is used to identify different metadata on the server. In our product we have implemented the oai_dc
               metadata format.</p>
               <p>It can take a parameter called identifier that matches  with <b>Plone object identifiers</b>. For example if you
               have an object called "aaa", the identifier for view metadata formats in OAI would be "aaa".
               </p>

               <h3>ListSets</h3>
               <p>This verb is used to harvest the directories (Folderish objects) in a Plone site. It doesn't take any
                parameters.</p>

               <h3>ListRecords</h3>
               <p>This verb is used to get a list of records between dates. The OAI date format is yyyy-mm-dd.
									This verb take many parameters:
               <ul>
                  <li><b>from</b>: It is the start date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
                  <li><b>until</b>: It is the end date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
                  <li><b>metadataPrefix</b>: It is the name of the metadata format to disseminate. Currently, OAI intercom only supports oai_dc.
               </ul>
               </p>
               
               <h3>ListIdentifiers</h3>
               <p>This verb is used to get the headers of the elements in Plone. It takes the following parameters:

               <ul>
               <li><b>from</b>: It is the start date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
               <li><b>until</b>: It is the end date of the query. It has a format like yyyy-mm-dd.</li>
               <li><b>metadataPrefix</b>: It is the name of metadata format to disseminate. Currently, OAI intercom only supports oai_dc.
               </ul>
               </p>
                  <h3>GetRecord</h3>
                  <p>This verb is used for get Dublin Core about one record. It is fundamental to the repository harvesting process. It takes the following parameters: </p> 
               <ul>
               <li><b>identifier</b>: It is the identifier in Plone database.</li>
               <li><b>metadataPrefix</b>: It is the metadata format in which we will disseminate the format (oai_dc).</li>
               
               </ul>
