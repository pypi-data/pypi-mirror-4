     [--marker <value>]
     [--path-prefix <value>]
     [--max-items <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--marker"  (string)
   Use this only when paginating results, and only in a subsequent
   request after you've received a response where the results are
   truncated. Set it to the value of the "--marker" element in the
   response you just received.

"--path-prefix"  (string)
   The path prefix for filtering the results. For example:
   "/company/servercerts" would get all server certificates for which
   the path starts with "/company/servercerts" .

   This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a
   slash (/), listing all server certificates.

"--max-items"  (integer)
   Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum
   number of server certificates you want in the response. If there
   are additional server certificates beyond the maximum you specify,
   the "IsTruncated" response element will be set to "true" .
