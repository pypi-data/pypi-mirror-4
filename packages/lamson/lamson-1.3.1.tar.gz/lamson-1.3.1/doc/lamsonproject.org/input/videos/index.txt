Title:  Screencasts And Tutorials
Content-Type: text/html

<p>
This is the first screencast that walks you through the first half of the <a href="/docs/deploying_lamson.html">Deploying Lamson</a>
tutorial.  It is the first screencast so it's probably rough and the sound isn't so great.  If you have tips and feedback on doing these
better <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> and let me know.
