'''This module provides an abstraction of controlled vocabularies.

This abstraction allows our application to work with both local and remote
vocabs (be they SOAP, REST, XML-RPC or something else).

The basic idea is that we have skos providers. Each provider is an instance
of a VocabularyProvider. The same class can thus be reused with different
configurations to handle different vocabs.
