        =========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `deform`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`deform`: http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/deform/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.deform``) are published to some URL.
        
        Included resources
        ------------------
        
        ``js.deform`` is different from most ``js.`` packages in that it doesn't
        include any resources itself.  It references the resources from ``deform``
        instead.  The only resources that are made available from ``js.deform``
        are ``deform.js``, ``form.css`` and ``beautify.css``.  All other resources
        that are part of the ``deform`` distribution are available separately:
        
          - jQuery (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.jquery)
          - jQueryUI (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.jqueryui)
          - jQueryUI Timepicker Addon (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.jquery_timepicker_addon)
          - jQuery Form (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.jquery_form)
          - jquery.maskedinput (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.jquery_maskedinput)
          - jquery-maskmoney (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.jquery_maskmoney)
          - TinyMCE (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/js.tinymce)
