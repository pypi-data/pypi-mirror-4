Management Plugin
=================

This example illustrates the use of the vFabric Administration Server (VAS) Python API to provision a RabbitMQ installation, create a Rabbit instance, and enable the management plugin on the instance. The instance is then started and the example waits for ``enter`` to be pressed. At this point the management plugin's web UI is available on port 55672. You can login with the default username ``guest`` and the default password ``guest``. Upon ``enter`` being pressed, the instance is stopped and the provisioned environment is cleaned up.

The example creates a group from all of the nodes that are known to the server, i.e. thanks to VAS's group-based administration, the provisioning of the Rabbit installation, creation of the instance, and enabling of the management plugin will occur on every node that's known to the server.

Running the example
-------------------

The example requires two arguments:

* The path to the Rabbit installation image .zip file (Windows) or .tar.gz file (Unix)
* The installation image's version

For example::

    ./management_plugin.py rabbitmq-server-generic-unix-2.8.4.tar.gz 2.8.4

The example also supports a number of options, allowing you to customize the details used to connect to the administration server. Use ``--help`` for more details::

    ./management_plugin.py --help
