request-cancel-workflow-execution
*********************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Records a "WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested" event in the currently
running workflow execution identified by the given domain, workflowId,
and runId. This logically requests the cancellation of the workflow
execution as a whole. It is up to the decider to take appropriate
actions when it receives an execution history with this event.

Note: If the --run-id is not specified, the
  "WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested" event is recorded in the history
  of the current open workflow execution with the specified
  --workflow-id in the domain.

Note: Because this action allows the workflow to properly clean up and
  gracefully close, it should be used instead of  terminate-workflow-
  execution when possible.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
