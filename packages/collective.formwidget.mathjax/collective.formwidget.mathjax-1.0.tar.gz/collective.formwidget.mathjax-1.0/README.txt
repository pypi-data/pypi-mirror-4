Introduction
============

This package adds a widget to z3cform widgets so you can have a textarea field with a TeX Preview div on the edit form.

It also loads the MathJax on the registry so it's not necessary to have collective.mathjax

TODO
====

* Pulish the js on the edit form
* Tests
* Load needed script.js only on edit of a type that has this kind of widget
