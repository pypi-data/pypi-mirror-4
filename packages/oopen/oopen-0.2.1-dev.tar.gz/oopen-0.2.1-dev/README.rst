OOpen
=====
*Object-Oriented file and path handling.*



The std lib file and path options aren't very pythonic.

I should be able to perform basic tasks directly on the file.

**Status: In development.**

'/Users/ajhekman/Projects/oopen/oopen'

Retrieve other file information:
--------------------------------
>>> oofile.sha1
'e90296612f91b8adf498884b20c8356113c83a73'
