PyXB: Python XML Schema Bindings
################################

PyXB ("pixbee") is a pure `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package that
generates Python source code for classes that correspond to data structures
defined by `XMLSchema <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>`_.  The generated classes
support bi-directional conversion between `XML <http://www.w3.org/XML/>`_
documents and Python objects.  In concept it is similar to `JAXB
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXB>`_ for Java and `CodeSynthesis XSD
<http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/>`_ for C++.  A
:ref:`thirty_sec_example` is at the bottom of this page.  Step-by-step
examples are in :ref:`userReference`.

Thirty Second Example
*********************

An example of a program using PyXB to interact with a `web service
<http://wiki.cdyne.com/wiki/index.php?title=CDYNE_Weather>`_ using an
automatically-generated module.  First, retrieve the WSDL and generate the
bindings::

  llc[1394]$ pyxbgen \
      --wsdl-location=http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL \
      --module=weather \
      --write-for-customization
  urn:uuid:c9f96a32-b700-11e1-b837-c8600024e903
  Retrieving WSDL from http://wsf.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/Weather.asmx?WSDL
  Importing pyxb.binding.datatypes to get binding for wildcard {http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}schema
  NOTE: Created unbound wildcard element from value in schema
  PS urn:uuid:c9f96a32-b700-11e1-b837-c8600024e903
  Complex type {http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/}WeatherReturn renamed to WeatherReturn_
  Complex type {http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/}ArrayOfWeatherDescription renamed to ArrayOfWeatherDescription_
  Complex type {http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/}ForecastReturn renamed to ForecastReturn_
  Python for http://ws.cdyne.com/WeatherWS/ requires 1 modules
  Saved binding source to ./raw/weather.py

Then write a program that uses them:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/weather/client_get.py

And run it::

 llc[1395]$ python client_get.py 
 Weather forecast for Saint Paul, MN:
  Friday, June 15 2012: Partly Cloudy, from  to 85
  Saturday, June 16 2012: Thunder Storms, from 67 to 81
  Sunday, June 17 2012: Sunny, from 62 to 84
  Monday, June 18 2012: Partly Cloudy, from 69 to 86
  Tuesday, June 19 2012: Thunder Storms, from 68 to 81
  Wednesday, June 20 2012: Thunder Storms, from 68 to 83
  Thursday, June 21 2012: Partly Cloudy, from 62 to 73

That's it.
