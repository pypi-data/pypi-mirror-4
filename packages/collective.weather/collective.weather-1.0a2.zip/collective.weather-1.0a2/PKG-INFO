        A Plone viewlet to display the weather at selected locations.
        
        Package supports `Yahoo! Weather`_, `Google`_ Weather and `NOAA`_'s `National
        Weather Service`_.
        
        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        Go to Plone's control panel and open Weather Setup.
        
        Select the service you want to use and the list of location ids that are going
        to be available on the viewlet.
        
        The user will be able to select from one of those locations. This information
        will be stored inside a browser cookie.
        
        The current weather condition of the selected location will be displayed at
        the viewlet.

        Current Status
        --------------
        
        At this moment, `Yahoo! Weather`_ is the only service currently working.
        As per 2012/09/14 `Google`_ Weather has stopped working and `NOAA`_'s `National Weather Service`_
        is not currently implemented.
        
        Yahoo Weather
        -------------
        
        In order to load locations to be used with the Yahoo! Weather service, you need to enter each one in the following format:
        
        id|name|location_id
        
        Where "id" should be a unique value and not repeated between any of the cities.
        "name" is the name to be shown in the drop down, this doesn't need to be unique.
        "location_id" is the id used by `Yahoo! Weather`_ to get the forecast information.
        
        To know the location id for specific places, go to that location in `Yahoo! Weather`_ and the location id is part of the url.
        For example, in the case of "Los Angeles" (http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/USCA0638.html) the location id would be "USCA0638"

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.weather`` to the list of eggs
           to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.weather
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.1, you may need to extend a Dexterity known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up Dexterity::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ''collective.weather'' and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
