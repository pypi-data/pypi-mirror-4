    """A container component with freely designed layout and style. The
    layout consists of items with textually represented locations. Each item
    contains one sub-component, which can be any Muntjac component, such as a
    layout. The adapter and theme are responsible for rendering the layout
    with a given style by placing the items in the defined locations.

    The placement of the locations is not fixed - different themes can define
    the locations in a way that is suitable for them. One typical example
    would be to create visual design for a web site as a custom layout: the
    visual design would define locations for "menu", "body", and "title", for
    example. The layout would then be implemented as an XHTML template for
    each theme.

    The default theme handles the styles that are not defined by drawing the
    subcomponents just as in OrderedLayout.
