Description: 
        XRecord is not an attempt to match the functionality of existing ORMs. 
        It's designed as a plug and play component to a well defined, 
        (foreign keys, primary keys, references) already existing database.
        
        Features
        ========
        
          * full introspection, no model definition in Python required,
          * automatic foreign key mapping, both in the referenced and referencing objects,
          * automatic many-to-many relationship detection,
          * optional foreign-key references caching,
          * easily extend generated record classes to provide extra functionality for your objects,
          * easily define FK and MTM relationships, that were left out in the database definition,
          * object-mapping of any SQL statement,
          * seamless integration with Django,
          * may store meta-data to improve performance in production environments,
          * may be used without writing a single line of SQL,
          * multiple-column primary keys,
          * database connection objects designed for long-running applications,
          * complies with the python DBAPI specification
