PyarrFS - a RAR reading file system
===================================

PyarrFS is a FUSE based file system to access the content of RAR archives as if
they were just normal files and directories. PyarrFS owes technically to FUSE
and rarfile, while the idea originates out of YarrFS - a similar file system
written a few years back by a colleague (and based on my idea).

This code was inspired by the xmp.py example written by Jeff Epler and Csaba
Henk. Thank you!

Thanks to the folks who wrote FUSE and thanks to Marko Kreen for putting
together rarfile!


PyarrFS is developed on Ubuntu and is thus known to work on that platform
together with fairly recent versions of Debian. Other Linux platforms are also
likely to work. Have you tried it on a different platform, please do tell :)
