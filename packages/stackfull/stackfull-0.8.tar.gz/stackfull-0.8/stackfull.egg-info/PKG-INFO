Description: PYTHON STACKFULL
        ================
        
        This small utility package provides functions to be used
        inside Pythob expressions that provide functionality
        like that available in stack-based languages
        (such as forth and postscript).
        
        It registers a hidden variable in the current
        running frame, which is a plain Python list -
        calls to plain "push, pop, dup, retr", etc...
        will just push/recover elements from that list.
        
        The intent is that whenever in an expression
        a value is complicated to retrieve - (or 
        computationally extensive) - instead of
        having to retrieve it in a previous line
        and storing said value in a variable,
        one gets the ability to "push" teh value
        in this implicit stack - and retrieve it
        in another part of the same expression:
             
        result = pop().upper() if not push(get_my+expensive_value()).isdigit() else pop()
        
        For conveninece, most functions return the valued passed
        to them in the first place (like the push above).
        
        Possibly in the future a decorator could  be provided
        to modify the bytecode of calling the functions defined
        in here to make use of the actual value stack running
        inside the Python VM. **Then this will be fun**
