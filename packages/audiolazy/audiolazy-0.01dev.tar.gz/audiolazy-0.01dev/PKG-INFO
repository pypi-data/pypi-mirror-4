        Expressive Digital Signal Processing (DSP) package for Python.
        
        
        Lazyness
        """"""""
        
        There are several tools and packages that let the Python use and
        expressiveness look like languages such as MatLab and Octave. However, the
        eager evaluation done by most of these tools make it difficult, perhaps
        impossible, to use them for real time audio processing. Another difficulty
        concerns expressive code creation for audio processing in blocks through
        indexes and vectors.
        
        
        Goal
        """"
        
        Prioritizing code expressiveness, clarity and simplicity, without precluding
        the lazy evaluation, and aiming to be used together with Numpy, Scipy and
        Matplotlib as well as default Python structures like lists and generators,
        AudioLazy is a starting project written in pure Python proposing digital
        audio signal processing (DSP), featuring a simple synthesizer, analysis
        tools, filters, biologial auditory periphery modeling, among other
        functionalities.

        This is the first deploy of a pre-alpha package. For now, you can use already
        the audiolazy.lazy_itertools with element-wise operators, and create your own
        filters with the lazy_filter module. Some documentation will be included soon.
