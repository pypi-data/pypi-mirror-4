        Introduction
        ============
        
        ZTFY.zmq is a small ZTFY integration of ZeroMQ library.
        
        It provides two main classes which are:
        
         - ZMQProcess, which is a ZMQ listening process, based on multiprocessing package.
        
         - ZMQMessageHandler, which is a simple ZMQ messages handler which delegates it's functionality
           to a ZMQ agnostic handling class.
        
        When creating a new ZMQProcess instance, you only have to specify it's listening address and it's messages
        handler.
        
        Default ZMQ process is based on request/response (REQ/REP) messages, but this can easily be overriden in
        custom subclasses.
        
        Most of this package main concepts are based on **Stefan Scherfke** work. Thanks to him!
