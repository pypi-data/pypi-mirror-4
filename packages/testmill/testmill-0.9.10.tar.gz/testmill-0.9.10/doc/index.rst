Welcome to Ravello TestMill
===========================

Ravello TestMill is an orchestration tool to build single- and multi-VM
application environments on the fly from a textual description and run
workflows in them. The focus is on providing clean and high-fidelity
environments for running any kind of development and test workloads, including
per-developer development environments, unit tests, system tests, integration
tests, functional tests and usability tests.

TestMill uses the `Ravello`_ `Cloud Application Hypervisor`_ as the
virtualization engine to reproduce almost any legacy or new-app environment in
the cloud with high fidelity. It also uses the excellent `Fabric`_ toolkit as a
robust remote execution environment on which the workflows are built.

TestMill fully subscribes to the devops mantra of *Infrastructure as Code*. The
environments that TestMill builds and manages are described by a concise
textual format that can be version controlled, and is intended to be part of
the repository containing the code it provides infrastructure for.
