"""
The :mod:`lino.runtime` module 
provides a stable transparent API which encapsulates 
the startup internals.

Lino application developers must just know the following:
Lino needs to do certain things "at startup" 
(i.e. when the models cache has been populated).
Most application code which uses Lino features will break 
if this startup hasn't been called.
And because Django unfortunately doesn't provide 
a signal or other method to specify things that 
should be run automatically at startup, 
we need to use some tricks.

The tricks are:

- Lino comes with wrappers that "override" Django's 
  dumpdata and loaddata management commands.
  
- If Application developer write their own management commands, 
  they should use ``from lino.runtime import settings`` instead 
  of the usual ``from django.conf import settings``.

- Unlike :mod:`lino.dd`, the :mod:`lino.runtime`
  **may not** be imported at the top level of "models modules".
