        How it works
        ============
        
        #. Visitor comes to ``yoursite.com/order`` (or similar) and clicks `Order` link.
        #. Visitor is sent to JVZoo's order form (on ``http://jvzoo.com``),
           where he enters his personal information and performs payment.
        #. JVZoo calls-back a special view on your plone site (``/@@jvzoo``),
           which reads POST data from JVZoo, verifies it against your
           ``Secret Key`` and creates a new member.
        #. The following information is stored in member data for later use:
        
            ``product_id``
                JVZoo's `Product ID` of the purchased item.
        
            ``product_name``
                JVZoo's `Product Name` of the purchased item.
        
            ``affiliate``
                Affiliate who referred the buyer.
        
            ``last_purchase_id``
                JVZoo's `Receipt ID` of the last purchase. This field gets updated
                on every recurring payment.
        
            ``last_purchase_timestamp``
                Exact timestamp of the last purchase. This field gets updated on every
                recurring payment.
        
        #. Upon creating a new member, Plone sends an email with login password.
        #. An ``IMemberCreateEvent`` is emitted upon creating a new member.
        #. The new member can now login and use the site.
        #. It is possible to create a ``product_id`` to ``group_name`` mapping in
           Plone Control Panel. This means that if a member purchased a product which
           is listed in this mapping, the member will also be added to a group mapped
           to this product.
        
        .. note::
        
            If a member already exists in Plone, then the ``@@jvzoo`` view simply
            updates ``last_purchase_id`` and ``last_purchase_timestamp`` member fields.
            The member will also be added to the new product group, but also kept in
            the old.
        
        
        Demo
        ====
        
        You can see this product in action at
        `BigContentSearch <http://bigcontentsearch.com/>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        To install ``niteoweb.jvzoo`` you simply add
        ``niteoweb.jvzoo`` to the list of eggs in your buildout, run
        buildout and restart Plone. Then, install `niteoweb.jvzoo` using the
        Add-ons control panel.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        JVZoo
        -----
        
        Go to `JVZoo.com <http://jvzoo.com>`_ and use ``Sellers`` ->
        ``Add a Product`` to add a new `Product`.
        
        Then check the option ``External Program Integration``. For `URL`
        set ``http://yoursite.com/@@jvzoo``. Under the ``My Account`` page
        set the ``JVZIPN Secret Key``.
        
        
        Plone
        -----
        
        Go to ``Site Setup`` -> ``jvzoo`` control panel form and configure
        the ``Secret Key`` field by pasting in the `Secret Key` you defined above.
        
        You can also configure the ``product_id`` to ``group_name`` mapping. This comes
        in effect when member purchases a product which is listed in this mapping, the
        member will also be added to a group mapped to this product.
        
        For example, imagine you have the following in your mapping::
        
            1|basic-members
            2|premium-members
        
        Members purchasing the product with id ``1`` will be added to the
        ``basic-members`` group, whose purchasing ``2`` will be added to the
        ``premium-members`` group. For others, nothing will be done.
        
        When switching products, an updated member will be added to new product
        group, but also kept in the old group. No information is removed/deleted.
        
        
        Test it
        =======
        
        You are now ready to do a test buy! Go back to ``Sellers`` and click
        ``Test Purchases``. Select a product, click ``Create Test Purchase Code`` and
        finish by clicking the link in ``Buy / Link`` column in the table below. In
        order for the purchase link to work, the product needs to be activated in
        ``Sellers Dashboard`` (select a product and check ``Allow Sales``).
        
        Before you finish the transaction, you of course need to set up your Plone
        site to receive JVZoo server notifications.
        
        Confirm by logging-in to http://jvzoo.com and checking to see if there were any
        purchases (on ``Sellers`` tab). Also check if your received an email with
        username and password for accessing your site and try to login with them.
        
        
        Known issues
        ============
        
        * If members stop paying for monthly or yearly subscriptions, you have to
          manually delete them from your Plone site.
        
        * The same as above goes for any chargebacks or refunds. You have to manage
          them manually.
