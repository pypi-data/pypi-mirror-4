=========

* 0.1.7
    * If the indentation level of a set of lists (with the same list id) were
      mangled (Starting off with a higher indentation level followed by a
      lower) then the entire sub list (the list with the lower indentation
      level) would not be added to the root list. This would result in removing
      the mangled list from the final output. This issue has been addressed.
* 0.1.6
    * Header detection was relying on case. However it is possible for a lower
      case version of headers to show up. Those are now handled correctly.
* 0.1.4
    * Added a function to remove tags, in addition stripped 'sectPr' tags since
      they have to do with headers and footers.
* 0.1.3
    * Hyperlinks with no text no longer throw an error
    * Fixed a bug with determining the font size with an incomplete styles dict
* 0.1.2
    * Fixed a bug with determining the font size of a paragraph tag
* 0.1.1
    * Added a changelog
    * Styles are now stripped from hyperlinks
    * jinja2 is now used to render test xml
* 0.1.0
    * Correctly handle tables and paragraphs in lists. Before if there was a
      table in a list it would break the list into two halves, the half before
      the table and the half after the table (with the table inbetween them). Now
      if there is a table or paragraph in a list those elements get rolled into
      the list.
