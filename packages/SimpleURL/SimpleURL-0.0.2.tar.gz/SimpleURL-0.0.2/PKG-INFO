Description: 
        SimpleURL
        ======
        
        SimpleURL is based on Werkzeug routing system for Brubeck.
        
        Why not use regex based routing system?
        ----
        
        - Regex is hard.
        
        - Too complicated.
        
        - Easy to make mistake.
            Example
            ----
            @app.add_url_route('^/brubeck')
            @app.add_url_route('^/brubeck/\d')
        
            Above regex routes seems to be different but not.
            Request - `/brubeck` and `/brubeck/1` will match first because
            you have failed to place `$` at the end. As a developer you are not supposed
            to waste your time writing clever regex and debugging regex.
        
        
        Why Werkzeug ?
        ----
        
        - Simple
        
        - Extensively documented
        
        - Active community
        
        - Fully WSGI compatible
        
        - Various utility functions for dealing with HTTP headers such as
            `Accept` and `Cache-Control` headers
