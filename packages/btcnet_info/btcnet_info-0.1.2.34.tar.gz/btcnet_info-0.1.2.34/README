This is a bitcoin network information library.
Currently it is the backend polling implementation for bitHopper although anyone may use. Note that it uses gevent.

It has two main methods.
The first one returns a list of pools.
EX:

import btcnet_info
for pool in btcnet_info.get_pools:
    print pool.name
    print pool.shares
    
It also allows you to iterate over know coins
EX:

import btcnet_info
for pool in btcnet_info.get_coins():
    print coin.name
    print coin.difficulty
    
If you don't like this you can also get difficulties and exchange rates directly
EX:

import btcnet_info
print btcnet_info.get_difficulty('btc')
print btcnet_info.get_exchange('btc')
