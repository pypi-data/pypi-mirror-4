bucket3 0.9.0, 2012-11-13
-------------------------
- UI/UX:
	* configuration, theme and data files are "hidden" under .bucket3 dir
	* bucket3 command is simpler (bucket3 {init|new|2html|clear})
	* Users no longer need to specify the conf file as long as the work under
	the blog installation path.
	
- bug fixes

- bucket3/b3tools.py has much of the functionality that used to be in bhcket3.py
