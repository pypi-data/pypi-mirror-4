SIMADB_CLI

simadb_cli allows you to add similarities between artists to enhance and
complete last.fm results.

Maintaining a documentation is lot of work, because I intend to
distribute this piece of software on various distributions I wrote manual
page for both mpd_sima and simadb_cli.

Please consult them within data/ directory.

Manual pages are readable with the man command:
	man -l data/simadb_cli.1

html manual are available as well.
