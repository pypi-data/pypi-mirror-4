Description: DoctestAll
        ==========
        
        Recursive doctest-executing library and script for running doctest on projects.
        
        DoctestAll is a very simple solution for running unit tests a package at a time,
        recursively descending with the ```__all__``` module property to find children
        to analyze. Or audit, if you want a creepy scientology metaphor.
        
        DTA is available as the ```doctestall``` module, and a script by the same name
        which can be run from the command line.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        DTA can be installed by entering the following commands as administrator:
        
            git clone git://github.com/campadrenalin/DoctestAll.git
            cd DoctestAll
            python setup.py install
        
        Once installed, you can import the doctestall module, or try it out in the shell:
        
            doctestall doctestall
        
        Yes, this runs doctestall _on itself._ But to test some other module:
        
            doctestall cmath
        
        The cmath module doesn't use doctest, so the results are uninteresting, but on
        the other hand, the recursive walk doesn't make anything explode either. So you
        might want to try it out on projects that are actually designed to use DTA, or
        at least be friendly to it.
        
        
        Projects using or compatible with DTA:
