unsubscribe
***********


DESCRIPTION
===========

The unsubscribe action deletes a subscription. If the subscription
requires authentication for deletion, only the owner of the
subscription or the its topic's owner can unsubscribe, and an AWS
signature is required. If the unsubscribe call does not require
authentication and the requester is not the subscription owner, a
final cancellation message is delivered to the endpoint, so that the
endpoint owner can easily resubscribe to the topic if the unsubscribe
request was unintended.

     --subscription-arn <value>


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
