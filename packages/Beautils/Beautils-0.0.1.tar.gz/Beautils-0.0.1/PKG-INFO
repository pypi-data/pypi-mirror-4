Description: # Beautils
        
        Utilities to make your Python more beautiful.
        
        You probably shouldn't use this, but if you must. It currently consists of a single function called gettimestamp which gives you the timestamp for any given datetime object.
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        import datetime
        from beautils import gettimestamp
        
        d = datetime.datetime(2013,1,31)
        ts = gettimestamp(d)
        # do something with ts
        
        ```
