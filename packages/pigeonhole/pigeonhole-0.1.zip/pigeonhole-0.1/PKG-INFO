        Introduction
        ============
        
        Pigeonhole is a tool used to create dashboards from templates rendered with mr.bob:
        
            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.bob
        
        A complete example of using Pigeonhole is currently under development:
        
            https://github.com/maikroeder/encode.mouse
        
        To get an idea of what kind of dashboards you will be able to produce with Pigeonhole, have 
        a look at the ENCODE RNA Dashboards (human and mouse):

        Design
        ======
        
        The post_render hook of mr.bob is used to get hold of the configuration for individual
        mr.bob runs. This way, Pigeonhole does not need to know how mr.bob does its magic, and
        can concentrate on plugging the individual templates together by calling them on demand
        while rendering the dashboard.
        
        Zope Page Template support for mr.bob
        =====================================
        
        Pigeonhole extends mr.bob with a renderer for Zope Page Templates, which can be 
        used instead of the default Jinja2 templates: 
        
            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.pagetemplate
        
        To use this renderer, place the following line in your .mrbob.ini:
        
            [template]
            renderer = pigeonhole.rendering:pagetemplate_renderer
