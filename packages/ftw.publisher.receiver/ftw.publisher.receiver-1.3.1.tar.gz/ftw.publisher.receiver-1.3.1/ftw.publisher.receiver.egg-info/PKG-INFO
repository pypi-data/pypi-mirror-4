Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The `ftw.publisher` packages provide tools for publishing plone contents from
        one instance to another.
        
        This package should be installed on the receiver instance. It provides tools
        for unserializing publishing requests and creating, updating or deleting
        objects. See the links below for further information.

        =====
        
        The main project package is `ftw.publisher.sender` since it contains all the
        configuration panels and the most tools - but without the other mandatory
        packages it will not work.
