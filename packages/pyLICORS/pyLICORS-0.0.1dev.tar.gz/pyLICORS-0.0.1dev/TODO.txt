This is a really high-level todo list.  Nothing here is written
in stone--this is mostly just a collection of thoughts.  As such, not
everything in here will make sense to implement.  Each item really
needs fleshing out before decisions on implementation should be made.

Before launching into anything, check the PyPI website which has
the latest version of this TODO list.

- Let the user define their own ``KmeansData.py`` if they can get another wrapper to work.
   As long
   as it takes a matrix as input and returns ``"labels"`` and ``"centroids"`` it should
   work with the other functions.

- If for any reason Python prints an error that libraries from this list are not available, try the comment out any ``import`` statement
  that calls these libraries.
