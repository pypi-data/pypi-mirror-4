v0.1, 2012-10-26 -- Initial release.
v0.2, 2012-12    -- Corrected doctests for ring models in codon_spaces.py in keeping with published meaning of mu
                 -- Prints version number now
    		 -- Homotopy method for ring models, requiring addition of methods get_mutation_eigensystem() to CodonSpace children classes
		 -- --numsteps option to cmc to support homotopy method
		 -- Added numsteps parameter to the evolver initialization signature to support Homotopy method
		 -- a system exit condition for when method is "homotopy" and -c/--nc is not set, indicating initialization of a ring model.
                 -- support for double precision in CUDA method
		 -- removed "observables = cmcpy.observables.Observables()" from CUDA initializers
           	 -- Corrected the order of actions in initialization of ArdellSella Evolver subclasses.
