Description: A simple "hack" that changes Plone's built-in comment system to one
        that makes use of Ploneboard forums and conversations to manage
        comments.
        
        It has an overrides.zcml file which overrides that standard commenting
        template, so as soon as Zope is restarted the standard commenting
        doesn't work and PloneboardComments needs to be installed via the
        Plone Control Panel.  After installing, add a Ploneboard and Forum,
        and then a PloneboardComments object in the Plone root.  Configure the
        PloneboardComments object to point to the newly created Message Board,
        save and then edit again and select the right forum.
        
        PloneboardComments is "context-aware", so if you have one
        PloneboardComments object in the root, and another in for example
        /intranet/ - comments in intranet will be "ruled" by the closest
        PloneboardComments instance, the one in /intranet will override the
        one in the Plone root.
        
        The PloneboardComments features are controlled by the "Reply to item"
        permission, as well as the "Discussion enabled" portal_types property,
        similarly to how regular Plone comments are controlled.
        
        Note that the code that creates Conversation items in the Ploneboard
        Forums (in content/PloneboardComments.py) does not check whether a
        user actually has permission to create a Conversation item in the
        forum used for comments, this is considered an OK solution as a user
        can only create a conversation on an object they have discussion
        rights on.
        
        Note: context/PloneboardComments.py has 3 translations (prefixed i18n)
        which aren't getting translated.  So one has to manually set the
        Norwegian translations here if needed.  Any tips on how to fix this
        are more than welcome.
