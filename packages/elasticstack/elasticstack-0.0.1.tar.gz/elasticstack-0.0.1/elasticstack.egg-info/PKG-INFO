        Configurable indexing and other extras for Haystack (with ElasticSearch
        biases).
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_: the features in elasticstack have
          only been tested on 1.4.x.
        * `Haystack <http://www.haystacksearch.org/>`_: ElasticSearch support was only
          added in Haystack 2.x which is still in development. You'll need to install
          Haystack from source.
        * `ElasticSearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org/>`_: presumably any newish
          version will do, however the only version tested against so far is 0.19.x
        
        Features and goals
        ==================
        
        * Configurable indexing, from the project level to the field level
        * Class based views more like Django CBV's
        * Indexing and debugging helpers
        
        Some of these features are backend agnostic but most features have
        ElasticSearch in mind.
        
        For more background see the blog post `Stretching Haystack's ElasticSearch
        Backend
        <http://www.wellfireinteractive.com/blog/custom-haystack-elasticsearch-backend/>`_.
        
        Stability, docs, and tests
        ==========================
        
        This project is in 'alpha'! Index control *should* remain fairly stable but
        everything should be considred subject to change until beta. As of yet, no docs
        (see the aforementioned blog post to get started) and no tests (hold on to your
        butts).
        
        Why not add this stuff to Haystack?
        -----------------------------------
        
        This project first aims to solve problems related specifically to working with
        ElasticSearch. Haystack is 1) backend agnostic (a good thing), 2) needs to
        support existing codebases, and 3) not my project. Most importantly, adding
        these features through a separate Django app means providing them without
        needing to fork Haystack. Hopefully some of the features here, once finalized
        and tested, will be suitable to add to Haystack.
