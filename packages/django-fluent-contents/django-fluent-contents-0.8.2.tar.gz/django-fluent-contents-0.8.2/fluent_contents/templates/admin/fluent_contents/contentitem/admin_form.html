{% comment %}
This is the base template to render a ContentPlugin model.
The template can be replaced by defining ``admin_form_template`` in the plugin class.

The before_fieldsets and after_fieldsets blocks are added on purpose,
to allow plugins to easily extend this file.
{% endcomment %}
        {% block before_fieldsets %}{% endblock %}
        {% block fieldsets %}
        {% for fieldset in inline_admin_form %}
          {% include "admin/fluent_contents/fieldset.html" %}{# a admin/includes/fieldset.html that supports hidden fields #}
        {% endfor %}
        {% endblock %}
        {% block after_fieldsets %}{% endblock %}
