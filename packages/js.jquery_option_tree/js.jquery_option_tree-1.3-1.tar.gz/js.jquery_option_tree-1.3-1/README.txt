js.jquery_option_tree
*********************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery-option-tree`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery-option-tree`: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-option-tree/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_option_tree``) are published to some URL.
