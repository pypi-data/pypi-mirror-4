.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow that of
an application\-generated cookie. This policy can be associated only with
HTTP/HTTPS listeners.
.sp
This policy is similar to the policy created by CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy,
except that the lifetime of the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie follows
the lifetime of the application\-generated cookie specified in the policy
configuration. The LoadBalancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the
application response includes a new application cookie.
.sp
If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session stops
being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.
.IP Note
An application client must receive and send two cookies: the
application\-generated cookie and the special Elastic Load Balancing cookie
named \fBAWSELB\fP . This is the default behavior for many common web browsers.
