Description: =========
        Construct
        =========
        
        Construct is a powerful declarative parser for binary data.
        
        It is based on the concept of defining data structures in a declarative
        manner, rather than procedural code: Simple constructs can be combined
        hierarchically to form increasingly complex data structures. It's the first
        library that makes parsing fun, instead of the usual headache it is today.
        
        Construct features bit and byte granularity, symmetrical operation (parsing
        and building), component-oriented declarative design, easy debugging and
        testing, an easy-to-extend subclass system, and lots of primitive
        constructs to make your work easier:
        
         * Fields
         * Structs
         * Unions
         * Repeaters
         * Meta constructs
         * Switches
         * On-demand parsing
         * Pointers
         * And more!
