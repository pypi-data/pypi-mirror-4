Cutlass is a Python (2.7+) library for making web app backends.

It's a small, carefully-designed set of components which do basic jobs usually
done by a framework, without needing to be used together. Dependencies,
internal coupling, automatic behavior and magic are kept to a minimum. These
components snap together flexibly with each other and anything else that uses
WSGI, including most Python frameworks as well as best-of-breed libraries like
WebOb, Bottle and Werkzeug. (You don't have to know about WSGI, though you can
easily work at that level if you need to.)

This design lets you get started quickly, completely understand and control
what your app is doing, keep overhead down, and tailor your architecture and
components to your tastes and tasks.
