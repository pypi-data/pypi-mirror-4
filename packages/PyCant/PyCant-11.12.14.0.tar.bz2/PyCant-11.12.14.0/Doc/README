What is PyCant?
---------------

IPL Cantata++ (http://www.ipl.com/products/tools/pt400.uk.php) is a proprietary
framework for unit and integration testing. It stores and manages test results
in binary format, but can export them to plain text: this is the so-called
".ctr" file format that PyCant works with.

PyCant focuses on structural coverage. With Pycant, programmers can easily
detect without using the integrated IDE which functions are not fully covered.
They can filter out coverage results that are not meaningfull to them. For
example, Cantata++ unit test not only measures structural coverage of the
function being tested, but does this also for all functions involved. This often
results in a "FAIL" status, because programmers'goal may be limited to the
function under test.

One can also superimpose results from different test cases in a less strict way
than Cantata++ imposes. This allows reuse of old test results even if source
files have been modified since then (in a certain limit).

PyCant can be used to generate a spreadsheet report of structural coverage when
coupled with the "csv" module of Python. One can gather in a single file all the
results for later archive.

What PyCant cannot do?
----------------------

IPL Cantata++ IDE allows to export test results in ".ctr" file format, but does
not allow to import them. So that whatever you will do with PyCant and your
original test results file, you will never be able to look at the result of your
experiments with the IDE anymore. So one cannot cheat and show on the IDE fake
results.
