Release
=======

Steps for releasing a new version of GeoAlchemy. We assume below
that the new version is "x.y.z".

In ``setup.py`` change ``version`` from ``x.y.zdev`` to ``x.y.z``. Add
a new commit with that to the master branch on GitHub.

Verify that the tests pass.

Create Git tag::

    $ git tag -a x.y.z -m 'version x.y.z'
    $ git push upstream x.y.z

Upload to PyPI:

    $ python setup.py release

Edit ``setup.py`` again and change ``version`` from ``x.y.z`` to
``x.y.(z+1)dev`` (e.g. 0.7.3dev).

Edit ``doc/conf.py`` and change ``version`` and ``release`` to
``x.y.(z+1)``.

Add a new commit with that to the master branch on GitHub.
