Description: This is a small bit of Python code that wraps various Request objects
        and returns a corresponding "Response". The responses, in this case,
        come from saved files on disk rather than from actually loading the
        web page.
        
        The intended use of this module is in automated testing of scraping
        code.
        
        For now, it targets only "scrapy". It'd be great to have a version of
        this that targeted "python-requests" as well.
        
        Contributions are very welcome, and we use the bug tracker in the Github
        project.
