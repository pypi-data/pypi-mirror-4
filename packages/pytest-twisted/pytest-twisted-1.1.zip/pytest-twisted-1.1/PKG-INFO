        pytest-twisted is a plugin for pytest, which allows to test code,
        which uses the twisted framework. test functions can return Deferred
        objects and pytest will wait for their completion with this plugin.
        
        Installation
        ==================
        Install the plugin with::
        
            pip install pytest-twisted
        
        
        Using the plugin
        ==================
        
        The plugin must be enabled. This can be done in the following ways:
        
        1. Run py.test with the --twisted command line option
        
        2. Put the following into conftest.py::
        
            pytest_plugins = "pytest_twisted"
        
        3. Put the following into pytest.ini::
        
            [pytest]
            twisted = 1
        
        That's all.
