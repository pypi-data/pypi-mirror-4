WTForms-Components
==================

WTForms-Components provides various additional fields, validators and widgets
for WTForms.

Fields
======


SelectField
-----------

This SelectField provides support for optgroups.

PhoneNumberField
----------------

PhoneNumberField is a string field representing a PhoneNumber object from
`Python phonenumbers library`_.

.. _Python phonenumbers library:
   https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers

The following example shows that the field takes the phone number's country
code and display format as parameters. ::

    import phonenumbers
    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms_components import PhoneNumberField

    class UserForm(Form):
        phone_number = PhoneNumberField(
            country_code='FI'
            display_format=phonenumbers.PhoneNumberFormat.NATIONAL
        )

Validators
==========

DateRange validator
-------------------

The DateRange validator is essentially the same as wtforms.validators.NumberRange validator but validates
dates.

In the following example we define a start_time field, which does not accept dates in the past. ::

    from datetime import datetime
    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import DateField
    from wtforms_components import DateRange

    class EventForm(Form):
        start_time = DateField(
            validators=[DateRange(min=datetime.now())]
        )

If validator
------------

The If validator provides means for having conditional validations. In the following example we only
validate field email if field user_id is provided. ::


    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import IntegerField, TextField
    from wtforms_components import If

    class SomeForm(Form):
        user_id = IntegerField()
        email = TextField(validators=[
            If(lambda form, field: field.user_id.data, Email())
        ])


Chain validator
---------------


Chain validator chains validators together. Chain validator can be combined with If validator
to provide nested conditional validations. ::


    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import IntegerField, TextField
    from wtforms_components import If

    class SomeForm(Form):
        user_id = IntegerField()
        email = TextField(validators=[
            If(
                lambda form, field: field.user_id.data,
                Chain(DataRequired(), Email())
            )
        ])
