Cookie User Folder - Custom Forms: Place to store custom login pages
 
    Description
 
        This is where you instantiate a custom login page. Simply
        select the type of object you want for your custom login 
        from the Add list and fill in the contents.
 
    **Warning**
 
      It is *very easy* to lock yourself out of your own site if you
      instantiate a login page that does not do the right thing
 
 
      Check out the code in the CookieUserFolder install directory
      under dtml/login.dtml for what a login page has to do. You
      want to make sure that you have a *form* which posts at
      least 2 input fields named *__ac__name* (user name) and
      *__ac_password* (password) back.
 
 
    **Help, I locked myself out of my own site!**
 
      This can happen if you create a custom login page within
      the CookieUserFolder which does not do the right thing.
 
      In order to authenticate you can force the usage of the
      default login page by going to:
 
      http://my.site.com/acl_users/docLogin
 
      Type in your name and password and hit the button. You
      will stay on the same page, even if the authentication
      succeeded, you can then type the desired address into your
      browser's navigation bar.
