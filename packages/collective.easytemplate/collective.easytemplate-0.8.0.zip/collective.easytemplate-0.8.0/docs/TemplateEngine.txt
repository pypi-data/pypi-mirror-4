About the template engine backends
==================================

By default, Jinja 2 template engine is used. 
Please refer to `Jinja 2 documentation <http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/documentation/templates>`_
for syntax. This syntax is very easy non-XML syntax resembling Django templates.

Easy syntax means that for the basic usage, no HTML knowledge is needed.
You can use template logic in both the HTML source code and visual editor views. 

Template engine is switchable in the application code. Besides Jinja, 
Django and Cheetah engines are supported by `collective.templateengines <http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=pkg_edit&name=collective.templateengines>`_
backend. 

Only on Jinja engine Zope security is supported. Other template 
engines do not provide compatible sandboxes.
