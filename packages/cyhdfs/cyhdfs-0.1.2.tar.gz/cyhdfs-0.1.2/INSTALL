PREREQUISITES:
    * hadoop (with libhdfs and all its jar files) installed 
        on a machine where library will be build
    * java installed 
    * Cython (maybe not needed if cyhdfs.cpp compiles fine with your hadoop version)

INSTALL:
    edit setup.cfg: set
    hadoop_home=base directory of hadoop
    include_dirs=libhdfs include path and java jni.h include path
    library_dirs and rpath=libhdfs.so and java shared library path

    hadoop_delete_recursive=1 means hdfsDelete() has second parameter int recursive
    hadoop_hflush=1 means libhdfs exports hdfsHFlush()

    then install as always:
    python ./setup.py build
    sudo python ./setup.py install

    If you with to run tests:
    nosetests -s ./tests
