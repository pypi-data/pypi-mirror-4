Description: # PMAP
        
        `pmap` is a multithreaded `map` functional operator that, differently from other implementations, _keeps the ordering_ of the input list.
        
        Usage examples:
        
        
            In [1]: from pmap import pmap
        
            In [2]: pmap (lambda x:x*x, range(10))
            Out[2]: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
