        Usage

        Easiest way to install:
        
            pip install closure-soy
        
            pip install webassets-closure-soy
        
        You can set environment variables to use your own SoyToJsSrcCompiler.jar
        but this package will look for the ``closure-soy`` package for easy setup.
        
        In your assets.py file:
        
            from webassets_ext import ClosureSoyFilter
        
            from webassets.filter import register_filter
        
            register_filter(ClosureSoyFilter)
        
        Then use filter="closure_soy" wherever you want to use it.
        If you want to chain it with a js minifer, make sure that
        closure_soy comes first in the list of filters.
