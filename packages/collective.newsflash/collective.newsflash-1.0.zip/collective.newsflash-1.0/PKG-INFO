        ----------------------------------
        
        News ticker inspired by the one on the `BBC News`_ website.
        
        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        After installing the product, you should get a portlet on the left side of
        your site, with a "Manage News Flashes" link. If you want, you can go to
        ``@@manage-portlets``, remove it and add it somewhere else.
        
        Clicking this "Manage News Flashes" link, you should get a view for adding,
        modifying or removing news flashes, in an overlay, if your browser supports
        Javascript.
        
        After clicking "Save", and reloading your site, you should get the news
        flashes rolling over the top section.
        
        Configuring
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The product includes a configlet, which allows you to customize the news
        flash. Going to "Site Setup" -> "News Flash Settings" you can:
        
        - Change the title text.
        - Change the speed in which the text appears.
        - Change the time that the text remains in the screen.
        - Hide/Show a widget to control the texts flow.
        
        Mostly Harmless

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.newsflash`` to the list of eggs
           to install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.newsflash
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.1 you may need to extend a five.grok known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that    you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up five.grok::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/five.grok/1.2.0-1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.newsflash`` and click the 'Activate'
        button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
