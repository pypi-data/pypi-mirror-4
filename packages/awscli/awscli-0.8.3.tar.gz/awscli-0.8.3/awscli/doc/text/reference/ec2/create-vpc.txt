create-vpc
**********


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a VPC with the CIDR block you specify. The smallest VPC you
can create uses a "/28" netmask (16 IP addresses), and the largest
uses a "/18" netmask (16,384 IP addresses). To help you decide how big
to make your VPC, go to the topic about creating VPCs in the Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud Developer Guide.

By default, each instance you launch in the VPC has the default DHCP
options (the standard EC2 host name, no domain name, no DNS server, no
NTP server, and no NetBIOS server or node type).


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 create-vpc

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--cidr-block"  (string)

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================
