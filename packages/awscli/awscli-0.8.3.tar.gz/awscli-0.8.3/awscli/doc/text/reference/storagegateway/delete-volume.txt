delete-volume
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation delete the specified gateway volume that you previously
created using the  create-storedi-scsi-volume API. For gateway-stored
volumes, the local disk that was configured as the storage volume is
not deleted. You can reuse the local disk to create another storage
volume.

Before you delete a gateway volume, make sure there are no iSCSI
connections to the volume you are deleting. You should also make sure
there is no snapshot in progress. You can use the Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) API to query snapshots on the volume you
are deleting and check the snapshot status. For more information, go
to DescribeSnapshots in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API
Reference* .

In the request, you must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
storage volume you want to delete.
