Description: A TiddlyWeb plugin to dispatch tiddlers to asynchronous job queues.
        
        This plugin uses beanstalkd to provide an in memory queing system
        holding queues to external processes which will do something with
        the information in the queue. The general goal is to allow processing
        of tiddlers asynchronously: For example to do indexing, send mail,
        etc.
        
        The general model goes as follows:
        
        * In init() of the plugin two things happen:
        ** a Store HOOK for tiddler put and delete is registered, that hooke has
           one job: put a message in the default queue of beanstalkd
        ** N+1 external process are either forked or if launched by some other
           mechanism, registered. The '1' processs listens on the default
           queue and writes the tiddler ID into a queue named after each of
           the N external processes (e.g. a tube named 'index')
        
        * Each of the process listening on non-default tubes, processes
          the tiddler, and then deletes it from the queue.
        
        This is _highly_ experimental. You will need to be able to compile
        beanstalkd in order to use this.
