pywunder
=======================

Pywunder is a very simple wrapper around the wundergroudn weather API, at this stage it is mostly incomplete, providing only very simple access to the forecasts api.

To use it do the following::

    import pywunder
    client = pywunder.Client("your api key")
    forecasts = client.forecats("UK/London") #Gives you a four day forecast
    forecasts[0].description
    >>> u'Clear in the morning, then partly cloudy. High of 16C. Breezy. Winds from the SW at 15 to 20 km/h.'
