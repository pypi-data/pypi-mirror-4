|masai|, a framework for processing, analysing and modelling 
of solid state NMR spectra

:Version: 0.2.alpha.dev

Warning
=======

	|masai| is still experimental and under active development. 
	It is not mature nor stable. 
	Its current design is subject to major changes, reorganizations, bugs and crashes!!!.
	
	**Should I say? be patient as I expect a fully working version with the upcoming 0.2 stable release.**
	
	
What is |masai|?
==================

|masai| is a software written in python and partially in fortran.

It (will) provides a general framework for the processing, analysis and modelling 
of Solid State NMR spectra.

A *GUI* application allows users to make basic processing and fitting of NMR spectra
(for now limited to the Bruker format).

The *API* should also be accessible to be included in other programs.
