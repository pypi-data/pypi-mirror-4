This is a Python package providing the agglomeration of the necessary
TiddlyWeb and TiddlyWiki plugins constituting the TiddlyWebWiki vertical:

   A collaborative wiki environment using TiddlyWeb and TiddlyWiki.
   http://tiddlyweb.peermore.com/wiki/#TiddlyWebWiki

Note that this adds various twanager commands as well as a global
twinstance command which creates a TiddlyWebWiki instance in the given
directory, preconfigured with a tiddlywebconfig.py, client-side plugins
and default bag policies (there is no default user for the ADMIN role
used in those policies).


If tiddlywebwiki is installed as a Python package via pip or
easy_install, all dependencies are included automatically.

If you are installing from source run:

    python setup.py install

In a TiddlyWeb instance in which you want to use TiddlyWebWiki, add
the following to tiddlywebconfig.py:

config = {
        'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebwiki'],
        'twanager_plugins': ['tiddlywebwiki']
        }

(This is included in the default tiddlywebconfig.py generated by
twinstance.)
