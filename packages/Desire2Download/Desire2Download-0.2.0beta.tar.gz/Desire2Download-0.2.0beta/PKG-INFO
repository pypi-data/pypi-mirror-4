           ## Note ##
           UWaterloo recently updated Desire2Learn to 10.1 which broke a lot of functionality and introduced bugs.
           This update tries to mitigate some of them but there are a lot of them.
           The main issue is that the folder structure is not preserved and sub folders are not downloaded.
        
           Download all of the content from the University of Waterloo's
           new learning management system which uses Desire2Learn instead of the old Angel
           based UWACE.
        
           d2d was inspired by Jamie Wong's fabulous [UWAngel-CLI](https://github.com/phleet/UWAngel-CLI)
           written in Ruby.
        
           d2d is somewhat hacky and has not been tested extensively. If you do find a bug,
           please [let us know](https://github.com/sholiday/desire2download/issues)
        
           To install, just do either:
        
               - python setup.py install
               - pip install desire2download
        
           To use d2d, just browse to the folder you want to download the files in, type
           d2d and hit enter! d2d will not download a file if it has been already saved.
        
           Examples:
               - d2d
               - d2d --username ktalwar
               - d2d -u ktalwar -p icanhazcatz
               - d2d -i ".*.ppt"
               - d2d -u scholida -p hecanhazcatz -i ".*.ppt" -c "CS+"
        
           Result:
               Username: scholida
