        by John Mark Schofield (jms@schof.org)
        
        Provides common utility functions for Django projects.
        
        (It's django-fu as in Kung Fu, not as in F-U.)
        
        
        
        Currently provides django-fu.djangoenvironment.get_env_variable().
        
        Loads an environment variable into the current context, or raises an exception.
        
        
        Thanks

        get_env_variable was taken from the book "Two Scoops of Django," by Daniel Greenfield and Audrey Roy. [https://django.2scoops.org/]
