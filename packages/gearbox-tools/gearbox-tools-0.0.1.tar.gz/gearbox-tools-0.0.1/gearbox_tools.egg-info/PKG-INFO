        tg-bootstrap
        ==================
        
        When ran inside a newly quickstarted TurboGears2 application will adapt the application to work with
        the SCSS version of bootstrap css framework.
        
        This command will add the ``tgext.scss``  dependency loaded through ``tgext.pluggable``, will create
        a bootstrap directory inside the project ``public_dir`` with the Twitter bootstrap framework inside and will
        patch the ``master template`` to use the SCSS version instead of the plain CSS one provided by default.
        
        
        tg-hgignore
        ==================
        
        This will create a ``.hgignore`` file suitable for TurboGears2 applications inside the directory where it
        is started.
        
        deploy-circus
        ==================
        
        When started inside a ``PasteDeploy`` application directory will generate a configuration for
        Mozilla Circus to deploy that application under circus supervision.
