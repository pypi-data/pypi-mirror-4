        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.6 (2013-01-29)
        ----------------
        
        - added travs-ci configuration [gborelli]
        - refactored tests with plone.app.testing [gborelli]
        - removed tests.base module [gborelli]
        - removed imports from zope.app [gborelli]
        - Changed control panel form in order to make it more user friendly [gborelli]
        - Fixed translation domain in the collectivegeo_macros [rnd0101]
        - Allowed OSM and overlay URL helper functions to take into account
          zoomOffset.
          [davidjb]
        - Ensuring that the maxExtent for spherical mercator covers all coordinates.
          [davidjb]
        - Automatically include OpenLayers language files if the language is
          supported by OpenLayers [href]
        - Added German translation [href]
        - Changed javascript to indicate map loading through the custom 'map-load' event,
          ensuring that invisible maps on tabbed forms are loaded only when made visible.
          Javascript code relying on collectivegeo.js must now implement
          $(window).bind('map-load', function(e, map) { }); which will be called once
          the map is ready. [href]
        - Disabled OpenLayer's KeyboardDefaults since they lead to the complete consumption
          of all + / - and arrow-key presses in input fields. [href]
        
        1.5 (2012-02-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Added French translation [Fabien Moret]
        - Added ability to hit enter key within geocoder input and search. Previously,
          hitting enter submitted the parent form.
          [davidjb]
        - Fix minor typo on geocoder error div
          [davidjb]
        - Replace deprecated usage of ``jq`` with ``$`` (using ``jQuery`` function)
          [davidjb]
        - Allow mapwidget to utilise HTTPS mapping resources, where possible, to
          attempt to avoid issues of loading insecure resources like map tiles. Only
          Google and Bing support HTTPS for their APIs at present - Yahoo and OSM do
          not. To avoid security errors, avoid the use of the latter two map APIs
          when on HTTPS.
          [davidjb]
        - Provide request protocol to layer templates
          [davidjb]
        - Make tests install the collective.geo.settings extension profile so
          plone.app.registry knows about settings.
          [davidjb]
        - Added Danish translation [stonor]
        
        
        0.1.4 (2011-09-05)
        ------------------
        - Changed javascript to bind window load event to create map. It fixes #29 [gborelli]
        - Added fix to reload OL map layers when the map is made visible after
          being loaded within a non-default Plone fieldset [davidjb]
        - added improvements about the Internationalization [macagua]
        - added support for Spanish localization for collective.geo.mapwidget domain [macagua]
        - Make our mapwidget automatically zoom to see a loaded WKT feature. [davidjb]
        - Show our default fieldset first on our form in accordance with changes in
          plone.app.z3cform 0.5.0+. [davidjb]
        - Added ability to display custom-styled maps with inline CSS.  This is based
          around width/height initially for either global or local custom settings
          but is extensible by mapping more fields. [davidjb]
        - added map_viewlet_managers in control panel form [gborelli]
        - plone 4.1 fixes [gborelli]
        - changed Browser import from Testing.testbrowser [gborelli]
        - removed zope.app.component import [gborelli]
        - changed map widgets jsfactory to provide a simple way to customize it [gborelli]
        - added z3c.autoinclude entry point [gborelli]
        - fixed layers query in maplayers
        - Added ability to drag features drawn onto OL map when editing [davidjb]
        - Minor spelling corrections [davidjb]
