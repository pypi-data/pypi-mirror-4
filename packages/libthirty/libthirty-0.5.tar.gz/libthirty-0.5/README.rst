=============

``libthirty`` is a python module that wraps the 30loops_ REST api in a easy to
use programming API. It's purpose is to function as a low level library that
can be used by other tools to provide a high level view on the 30loops_
platform.

Documentation still needs to be added, but you can check the ``thirty-cli``
package for a reference.
