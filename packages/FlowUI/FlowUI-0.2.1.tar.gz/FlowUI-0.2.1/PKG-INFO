Description: FlowUI is a simple presentation toolkit for
              text-based displays. What makes it different from other, similar user
              interfaces, is that it has been designed so that it can easily be
              embedded into a third-party application's interface without disrupting
              it.
        
              All widgets in FlowUI are designed so that they are rendered one
              character at a time and assuming the cursor is moved forward by one
              character so that the cursor never has to be repositioned.
