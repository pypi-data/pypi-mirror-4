ZODB3
=====

The ZODB3 package has been broken into ZODB, persistent, BTrees and
ZEO.  It is now just a meta-package that requires the others.

See the pages for those:

- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZODB
- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/persistent
- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BTrees
- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZEO

For general information about ZODB, see http://zodb.org.

Application developers should adjust their dependencies to depend on
the individual projects as needed.
