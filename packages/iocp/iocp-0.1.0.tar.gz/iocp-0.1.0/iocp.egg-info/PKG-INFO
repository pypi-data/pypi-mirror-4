Description: iocp tries to mimic Go's io.Copy function (http://golang.org/pkg/io/#Copy)
        which copies from everything that is an io.Reader to anything that is an
        io.Writer).
        
        The Python world of things is not that organized, so iocp.copy will try to do a
        best guess about which are the right function to call when reading and writing.
        
        For example, checking md5 signature of a file::
        
            md5 = hashlib.md5()
            with open('/path/to/file') as fo:
                iocp(fo, md5)
            print md5.hexdigest()
