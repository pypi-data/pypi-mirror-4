Setup
-----

To activate the ``kotti_gallery`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to add an
entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste Deploy config.  If
you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one.  The line in your
``[app:main]`` section could then look like this::

    kotti.configurators = kotti_gallery.kotti_configure

With this, you'll be able to add galleries in your site.
