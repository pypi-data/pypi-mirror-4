    BANDRED  Band reduction by two-sided unitary transformations.
         B = BANDRED(A, KL, KU) is a matrix unitarily equivalent to A
         with lower bandwidth KL and upper bandwidth KU
         (i.e. B(i,j) = 0 if i > j + KL or j > i + KU).
         The reduction is performed using Householder transformations.
         If KU is omitted it defaults to KL.

         Called by RANDSVD.
         This is a `standard' reduction.  Cf. reduction to bidiagonal form
         prior to computing the SVD.  This code is a little wasteful in that
         it computes certain elements which are immediately set to zero!
