set-alarm-state
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Temporarily sets the state of an alarm. When the updated "--state-
value" differs from the previous value, the action configured for the
appropriate state is invoked. This is not a permanent change. The next
periodic alarm check (in about a minute) will set the alarm to its
actual state.
