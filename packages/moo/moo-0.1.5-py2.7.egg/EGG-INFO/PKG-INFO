        	Moo is a mini markdown render server that provides preview of markdown 
        	files. It can automatically reload the preview in your broswer when the 
        	monitored file changes, which makes it suitable to live preview markdown
        	in editors that does not provide this feature. Plugins can be
        	easily written to interface with it.
