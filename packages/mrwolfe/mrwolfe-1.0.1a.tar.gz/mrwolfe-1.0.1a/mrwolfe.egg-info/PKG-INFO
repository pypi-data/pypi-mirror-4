Description: mrwolfe - "I'm Mr. Wolfe. I solve problems"
        ===========================================
        
        Mr.Wolfe is an issue tracker for support issues written in Django. It
        is not a tracker for software issues, like Bugzilla, Jira, etc. In the
        latter issues are related to software, and are tracked in terms of a
        life cycle from incoming to resolving in a specific software release
        (or closing without a release). Mr.Wolfe on the other hand tracks
        support issues, that may be questions, performance problems, software
        failures, etc. that tracks issues in terms of a life cycle fro
        perceived problem to solved problem.
        
        An issue in Mr.Wolfe may or may not result in a software issue.
        
        Issues in Mr.Wolfe are related to a Service Level Agreement, and are
        handled according to the services agreed in the SLA. Several services
        may be added to a SLA. 
        
        Issues are read from one or more mail queues (let's face it, customers
        will just keep sending those issues per mail) and dispatched to the
        proper SLA.
        
        The intended target audience of Mr.Wolfe is support teams and
        help desks; it is an alternative to the well known OTRS.
        
        See the docs directory in the package for further reading.
