Description: Python unittest test suite for Robot Framework
        ==============================================
        
        This is an experimental package
        for wrapping Robot Framework test suites into Python unittest suites
        to make it possible to run Robot Framework tests
        as `plone.testing`_'s layered test suites::
        
            import unittest2 as unittest
        
            from plone.testing import layered
            from robotsuite import RobotTestSuite
        
            from my_package.testing import ACCEPTANCE_TESTING
        
        
            def test_suite():
                suite = unittest.TestSuite()
                suite.addTests([
                    layered(RobotTestSuite('mysuite.txt'),
                            layer=ACCEPTANCE_TESTING),
                ])
                return suite
        
        *RobotTestSuite* splits Robot Framework test suites into separate
        unittest test cases so that Robot will be run once for every test
        case in every test suite parsed from the given Robot Framework
        test suite.
        Because of that, each Robot will generate a separate test report
        for each test.
        Each report will have it's own folder,
        which are created recursively
        reflecting the structure of the given test suite.
        
        *RobotTestSuite*'s way of wrapping tests into
        unittest's test suite is similar to how doctest-module's
        DocTestSuite does its wrappings.
        
        The main motivation behind this package is to make
        Robot Framework support existing test fixtures and test isolation
        when testing `Plone`_.
        Yet, this should help anyone wanting to use Robot Framework with
        `zope.testrunner`_ or other Python unittest compatible test runner.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.9.0 (2012-09-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Added injecting logged errors into captured stdout to be dumped with robot
          output when a test fails.
        
        0.8.0 (2012-09-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Added support for setting pybot cli-variables from ROBOT_-prefixed
          environment variables.
        
        0.7.0 (2012-09-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented custom merge for Robot Framework reports to create better
          concatenated test report and fully support Robot Framework plugin for
          Jenkins.
        - Fixed to copy (selenium-)screenshots into the root test directory to
          make it easier to publish them in Jenkins.
        
        0.6.0 (2012-08-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed screenshot paths in concatenated report.
        - Fixed test names to include suite filename instead of classname.
        - Fixed to allow dash in normalized test names.
        
        0.5.0 (2012-07-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Included robotframework test tags as part of tests' string representation
          to allow test be filtered with tags (e.g. with `zope.testrunner`_).
        - Added creation of concatenated log file.
        
        0.4.0 (2012-06-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed to rename test method of each test after the actual robot framework
          test run by the test case.

        ------------------
        
        - Enabled robotframework reports for tests. Each test suite and each test
          will have their own outputdir, recursively.
        
        0.2.0 (2012-06-02)
        ------------------
