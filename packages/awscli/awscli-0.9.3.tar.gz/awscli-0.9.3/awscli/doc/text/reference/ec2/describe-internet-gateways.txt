describe-internet-gateways
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your Internet gateways. You can filter the
results to return information only about Internet gateways that match
criteria you specify. For example, you could get information only
about gateways with particular tags. The Internet gateway must match
at least one of the specified values for it to be included in the
results.

You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the Internet gateway is
attached to a particular VPC and is tagged with a particular value).
The result includes information for a particular Internet gateway only
if the gateway matches all your filters. If there's no match, no
special message is returned; the response is simply empty.

You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero
or more characters, and "?" matches exactly one character. You can
escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For
example, a value of "\*amazon\?\\" searches for the literal string
"*amazon?\" .

         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
