.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBchange\-message\-visibility\fP action changes the visibility timeout of a
specified message in a queue to a new value. The maximum allowed timeout value
you can set the value to is 12 hours. This means you can\(aqt extend the timeout of
a message in an existing queue to more than a total visibility timeout of 12
hours. (For more information visibility timeout, see \fI\%Visibility Timeout\fP in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)
.sp
For example, let\(aqs say you have a message and its default message visibility
timeout is 30 minutes. You could call \fBChangeMessageVisiblity\fP with a value of
two hours and the effective timeout would be two hours and 30 minutes. When that
time comes near you could again extend the time out by calling
ChangeMessageVisiblity, but this time the maximum allowed timeout would be 9
hours and 30 minutes.
.IP Warning
If you attempt to set the \fB\-\-visibility\-timeout\fP to an amount more than the
maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not automatically
recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time remaining.
.RE
.IP Warning
Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific
message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in memory
for that message. If you don\(aqt delete a message after it is received, the
visibility timeout for the message the next time it is received reverts to the
original timeout value, not the value you set with the
change\-message\-visibility action.
