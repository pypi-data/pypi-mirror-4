create-db-instance-read-replica
*******************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a DB Instance that acts as a Read Replica of a source DB
Instance.

All Read Replica DB Instances are created as Single-AZ deployments
with backups disabled. All other DB Instance attributes (including DB
Security Groups and DB Parameter Groups) are inherited from the source
DB Instance, except as specified below.

Warning: The source DB Instance must have backup retention enabled.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws rds create-db-instance-read-replica
     --source-db-instance-identifier <value>
     --db-instance-identifier <value>
     [--availability-zone <value>]
     [--publicly-accessible ]
     [--auto-minor-version-upgrade ]
     [--iops <value>]
     [--option-group-name <value>]
     [--db-instance-class <value>]
     [--port <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--source-db-instance-identifier"  (string)
   The identifier of the DB Instance that will act as the source for
   the Read Replica. Each DB Instance can have up to five Read
   Replicas.

   Constraints: Must be the identifier of an existing DB Instance that
   is not already a Read Replica DB Instance.

"--db-instance-identifier"  (string)
   The DB Instance identifier of the Read Replica. This is the unique
   key that identifies a DB Instance. This parameter is stored as a
   lowercase string.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--availability-zone"  (string)
   The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone that the Read Replica will be
   created in.

   Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the
   endpoint's region.

   Example: "us-east-1d"

"--publicly-accessible"  (boolean)

"--auto-minor-version-upgrade"  (boolean)
   Indicates that minor engine upgrades will be applied automatically
   to the Read Replica during the maintenance window.

   Default: Inherits from the source DB Instance

"--iops"  (integer)
   The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
   to be initially allocated for the DB Instance.

"--option-group-name"  (string)
   The option group the DB instance will be associated with. If
   omitted, the default Option Group for the engine specified will be
   used.

"--db-instance-class"  (string)
   The compute and memory capacity of the Read Replica.

   Valid Values: "db.m1.small | db.m1.medium | db.m1.large |
   db.m1.xlarge | db.m2.xlarge |db.m2.2xlarge | db.m2.4xlarge"

   Default: Inherits from the source DB Instance.

"--port"  (integer)
   The port number that the DB Instance uses for connections.

   Default: Inherits from the source DB Instance

   Valid Values: "1150-65535"
