terminate-workflow-execution
****************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Records a "WorkflowExecutionTerminated" event and forces closure of
the workflow execution identified by the given domain, runId, and
workflowId. The child policy, registered with the workflow type or
specified when starting this execution, is applied to any open child
workflow executions of this workflow execution.

Warning: If the identified workflow execution was in progress, it is
  terminated immediately.

Note: If a --run-id is not specified, then the
  "WorkflowExecutionTerminated" event is recorded in the history of
  the current open workflow with the matching --workflow-id in the
  domain.

Note: You should consider using  request-cancel-workflow-execution action
  instead because it allows the workflow to gracefully close while
  terminate-workflow-execution does not.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For --details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf terminate-workflow-execution
     --domain <value>
     --workflow-id <value>
     [--reason <value>]
     [--child-policy <value>]
     [--details <value>]
     [--run-id <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The --domain of the workflow execution to terminate.

"--workflow-id"  (string)
   The --workflow-id of the workflow execution to terminate.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--reason"  (string)
   An optional descriptive --reason for terminating the workflow
   execution.

"--child-policy"  (string)
   If set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow
   executions of the workflow execution being terminated. This policy
   overrides the child policy specified for the workflow execution at
   registration time or when starting the execution. The supported
   child policies are:

   * **TERMINATE:** the child executions will be terminated.

   * **REQUEST_CANCEL:** a request to cancel will be attempted for
     each child execution by recording a
     "WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested" event in its history. It is up
     to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an
     execution history with this event.

   * **ABANDON:** no action will be taken. The child executions will
     continue to run.

   Note: A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified
     either as a default for the workflow type or through this
     parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child
     policy was specified at registration time, a fault will be
     returned.

"--details"  (string)
   Optional --details for terminating the workflow execution.

"--run-id"  (string)
   The --run-id of the workflow execution to terminate.
