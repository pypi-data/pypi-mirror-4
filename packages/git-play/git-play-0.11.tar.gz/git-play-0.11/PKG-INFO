        ========
        
        Git-play is a custom git command for deploying an application server very easily from a remote git repository. It checks the remote git repository every minute and if something has changed, it will restart the application server automatically.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can simply install git-play from PyPI by using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ pip install git-play
        
         
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Git-play is made for people who hate complicated configurations, thus basically it doesn't require you to do much except for ``.git-play.yml``.
        
        
        Configuring your git-play deployment with ``.git-play.yml``
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        Git-play uses the ``.git-play.yml`` file in the root of your repository to configure how you want your application server to be executed.
        ``.git-play.yml`` file has three parts: ``app``, ``setup``, ``teardown``.
        
        For your convenience, there are several examples of ``.git-play.yml`` file.
        
        Django
        ------
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
           app:
             workdir: ./mysite
             respawn: yes
             exec: python manage.py runserver
        
           setup:
             - pip install -r requirements.txt  
             - cd mysite
             - python manage.py syncdb
        
           teardown:
             - echo "The server is going down for maintanance..."
        
        
        Express
        -------
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
           app:
             respawn: yes
             env:
              PORT: 80
             exec: node app.js
        
           setup:
             - npm install
        
           teardown:
             - echo "The server is going down for maintanance..."
        
        
        Spray and pray!
        ---------------
        
        Lastly, all you have to do is simply type the following:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ git play http://github.com/foo/bar origin master
           Spawned!
        
        For an existing repository, type the following:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
           $ git play bar origin master
           Spawned!
