        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.behavior.localregistry`` to the
           list of eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.behavior.localregistry
        
        2. If you are using Plone 4.1 you may need to extend a Dexterity known good
           set (KGS) to make sure that you get the right versions of the packages that
           make up Dexterity::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            extends =
                http://good-py.appspot.com/release/dexterity/1.2.1
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.behavior.localregistry`` and click the
        'Activate' button.
