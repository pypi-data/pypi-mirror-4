Description: JS Project
        ============================================================================
        
        This package provides a pcreate scaffold for creating a `Fanstatic <http://fanstatic.org>`_ js.* library project.
        
        JS Project uses the Pyramid Scaffold pcreate command to create a barebones python project which provices a Fanstatic js.* resource.
        
        Usage
        _____
        
            $ pcreate -s js_project <project_name>
        
        The new project will contain dummy css and js files linked as Fanstatic resources. These resources are ready to be 'need()'ed (though of course they are empty.
