        ===============
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `Fine Uploader`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Fine Uploader`: http://fineuploader.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.fineuploader``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        You can import ``fineuploader`` from ``js.fineuploader`` and ``need`` it where
        you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.fineuploader import fineuploader
          >>> fineuploader.need()
        
        Or if you want the jQuery plugin version::
        
          >>> from js.fineuploader import jquery_fineuploader
          >>> jquery_fineuploader.need()
        
        With either version you might also want the CSS::
        
          >>> from js.fineuploader import fineuploader_css
          >>> fineuploader_css.need()
