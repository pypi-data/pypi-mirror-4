register-image
**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The register-image operation registers an AMI with Amazon EC2. Images
must be registered before they can be launched. For more information,
see RunInstances.

Each AMI is associated with an unique ID which is provided by the
Amazon EC2 service through the register-image operation. During
registration, Amazon EC2 retrieves the specified image manifest from
Amazon S3 and verifies that the image is owned by the user registering
the image.

The image manifest is retrieved once and stored within the Amazon EC2.
Any modifications to an image in Amazon S3 invalidates this
registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous
image and register the new image. For more information, see
DeregisterImage.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--description"  (string)The description describing the new AMI.

"--block-device-mappings"  (list)
   The block device mappings for the new AMI, which specify how
   different block devices (ex: EBS volumes and ephemeral drives) will
   be exposed on instances launched from the new image.

      (structure)
         The BlockDeviceMappingItemType data type.

         "device_name"  (string)
            Specifies the device name (e.g., "/dev/sdh" ).

         "virtual_name"  (string)
            Specifies the virtual device name.

         "no_device"  (string)
            Specifies the device name to suppress during instance
            launch.

         "ebs"  (structure)
            Specifies parameters used to automatically setup Amazon
            EBS volumes when the instance is launched.

            "delete_on_termination"  (boolean)
               Specifies whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on
               instance termination.

            "snapshot_id"  (string)
               The ID of the snapshot from which the volume will be
               created.

            "volume_size"  (integer)
               The size of the volume, in gigabytes.

            "volume_type"  (string)

            "iops"  (integer)

          "no_device": "string",
          "ebs": {
            {
              "delete_on_termination": true|false,
              "snapshot_id": "string",
              "volume_size": integer,

            }
        }
        ...
      ]

"--architecture"  (string)The architecture of the image.
   Valid Values: "i386" , "x86_64"

"--image-location"  (string)The full path to your AMI manifest in
Amazon S3 storage.

"--kernel-id"  (string)The optional ID of a specific kernel to
register with the new AMI.

"--ramdisk-id"  (string)
   The optional ID of a specific ramdisk to register with the new AMI.

   Some kernels require additional drivers at launch. Check the kernel
   requirements for information on whether you need to specify a RAM
   disk.

"--root-device-name"  (string)
   The root device name (e.g., "/dev/sda1" ).

"--name"  (string)
   The name to give the new Amazon Machine Image.

   Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parenthesis ( "()" ),
   commas ( "," ), slashes ( "/" ), dashes ( "-" ), or underscores(
   "_" )
