0.6.0 (2012-11-16)
------------------

- fix parts - prefixing concept for paste recipe. This changes will generate
  different paste config file names e.g. paste.conf - zope.conf, paste.zcml
  will become site.zcml. This change allows to use name=foo in your recipe and
  this will generate prefixed paste config names e.g. foo-zope.conf and
  foo-site.zcml. This allows to use the same parts folder and share the same
  ZODB within different paste configuration (e.g. dev, minified sources etc.)

- added script runner recipe and script. This script is useful for run other
  (more then one) scripts at once

- added initial code for ctags generation (windows support). Added note about
  ctags issue wit large set of sys.path packages. Fix default languages option
  and added langmap option and include page template files as HTML files.
