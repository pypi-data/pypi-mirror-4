KV - simple key/value store
===========================

KV provides a dictionary-like interface on top of SQLite. Keys can be
unicode strings, numbers or None. Values are stored as JSON.

::

    >>> from kv import KV
    >>> db = KV('/tmp/demo.kv')
    >>> db['hello'] = 'world'
    >>> db[42] = ['answer', 2, {'ultimate': 'question'}]
    >>> dict(db)
    {42: [u'answer', 2, {u'ultimate': u'question'}], u'hello': u'world'}


There is a locking facility that uses SQLite's transaction API::

    >>> with kv.lock():
    ...   l = db[42]
    ...   l += ['or is it?']
    ...   db[42] = l


And that's about it. The code_ is really simple.
