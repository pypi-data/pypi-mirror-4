Description: About the WeDo
        --------------
        
        The `Lego WeDo`_ is a tethered-over-USB sensing and robotics toolkit produced by Lego for the educational market.
        
        It's gotten lots of press, including a favorable review on the One Laptop Per Child blog, on `deployments and training in Peru`_.
        
        It's supported by Scratch(on Windows and OSX) and by Lego's proprietary software(on Windows.)
        
        It prominently features the LB1836_ motor driver and the LM358_ op-amp, as well as an epoxy blob with USB support.
        
        The digital communication protocol used by the Power Functions system is documented on `Philo's Awesome Page`_.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Python 2.7+
        - pyusb (setup.py should take care of installing the dependency)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From pypi:
        
            pip install wedo
        
        From the source tree:
        
            ./setup.py install
        
        
        How to Use it
        -------------
        
            >>> from wedo import WeDo
            >>> wd = WeDo()
            # Activating the first motor full forward:
            >>> wd.motor_a = 100
            # Activating the second motor half speed/force backward:
            >>> wd.motor_b = -50
            # Current value of the tilt sensor:
            >>> wd.tilt
            # Current distance value in meters of the distance sensor:
            >>> wd.distance
