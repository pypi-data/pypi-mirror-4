create-launch-configuration
***************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new launch configuration. The launch configuration name must
be unique within the scope of the client's AWS account. The maximum
limit of launch configurations, which by default is 100, must not yet
have been met; otherwise, the call will fail. When created, the new
launch configuration is available for immediate use.

You can create a launch configuration with Amazon EC2 security groups
or with Amazon VPC security groups. However, you can't use Amazon EC2
security groups together with Amazon VPC security groups, or vice
versa.

Note: At this time, Auto Scaling launch configurations don't support
  compressed (e.g. zipped) user data files.
