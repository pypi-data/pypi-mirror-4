        pyqcy
        =====
        
        *pyqcy* [pyksi:] is an automated testing framework for Python
        inspired by the wonderful *QuickCheck* library for Haskell.
        
        What's the idea?
        ----------------
        
        Instead of writing fully-fledged test cases, with *pyqcy*
        you simply define logical **properties** that your code
        is expected to satisfy. Based on that, *pyqcy* will
        automatically generate test cases for you - hundreds of them,
        in fact!
        
        How does it look like?
        ----------------------
        
        For starters, try this::
        
            from pyqcy import qc, int_, main
        
            @qc
            def addition_actually_works(
                x=int_(min=0), y=int_(min=0)
            ):
                the_sum = x + y
                assert the_sum >= x and the_sum >= y
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                main()
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pyqcy
            $ python test.py
            addition_actually_works: passed 100 tests.
        
        *pyqcy* generated 100 test cases and checked whether
        they all pass. For a few lines of code, that's rather nice,
        isn't it? :)
        
        Of course, you are not limited to integers - there is
        built-in support for all standard types, including lists
        and dictionaries. Custom classes can be used as well:
        just specify how to generate an *@arbitrary* object
        of your class, and you're set.
        
        Hey, I like it!
