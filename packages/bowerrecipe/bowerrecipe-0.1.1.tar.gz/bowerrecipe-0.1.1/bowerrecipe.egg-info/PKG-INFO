        Introduction
        ============
        
        This recipe allows downloading and installing assets such as images, CSS and JavaScript using Twitter Bower.
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        packages
            Packages that should be installed with bower. Packages specified here are
            passed to bower verbatim. They can be specified in any form that is
            supported by bower::
        
                packages =
                    underscore
                    git://github.com/components/jquery.git
                    bootstrap#2.2.2
        
        base-directory
            Absolute path to the bower "project" directory. ``bower install`` is run
            from this directory and the bower configuration file, ``.bowerrc`` is
            placed in this directory.  Optional; defaults to
            ``${buildout:parts-directory}/bower``. Requires an absolute path.
        
        executable
            Absolute path to the ``bower`` executable. Packages are installed using
            this executable. Optional; defaults to ``bower`` on ``PATH``.
        
        downloads
            Relative path, from the ``base-directory``, to the directory where bower
            will download packages to. This path is written to the ``.bowerrc`` file
            prior to running the executable. Optional; defaults to ``downloads``. Thus,
            the downloaded packages are placed in ``${base-directory}/downloads`` by
            default.
        
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        A sample buildout that uses this recipe could look like::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = node web
        
            [node]
            recipe = gp.recipe.node
            url = http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.16/node-v0.8.16.tar.gz
            npms = bower@0.6.8
            scripts = bower
        
            [web]
            recipe = bowerrecipe
            packages = jquery#1.8.3 normalize-css
            executable = ${buildout:bin-directory}/bower
        
        This would place the downloaded packages in ``parts/bower/downloads``.
        Modifying the ``web`` section to be::
        
            [web]
            recipe = bowerrecipe
            packages = jquery#1.8.3 normalize-css
            executable = ${buildout:bin-directory}/bower
            base-directory = ${buildout:parts-directory}
            downloads = components
        
        would result in bower placing the downloaded packages in ``parts/components``.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        #. Bower still looks at the ``~/.bowerrc`` file. Hence, if this file exists, it
           may affect the buildout bower configuration
        #. Bower still uses the cache located in the user's home directory. For me,
           this happens to be ``~/.bower/cache/``
