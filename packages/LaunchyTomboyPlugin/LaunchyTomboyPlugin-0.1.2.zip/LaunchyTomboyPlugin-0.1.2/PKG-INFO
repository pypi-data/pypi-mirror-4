Description: Introduction
        ---------------
        
        Launchy Tomboy Plugin
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        I have tested this setup with:
        
        - Windows 7
        - Python 2.7
        - `Launchy <http://www.launchy.net/>`_: 2.6 Beta 2
        - `Tomboy <http://projects.gnome.org/tomboy/>`_: 1.11.2
        - `PyLaunchy <http://pylaunchy.sourceforge.net/docs/>`_: 0.9
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Make sure the above requirements are met
        - install this package using pip, easy_install, or the .exe installer
        - create a file like the one below::
        
            # this file should reside at
            # <Launchy program dir>\plugins\python\pytomboy.py
            from os import environ as ose
            import launchy
        
            # uncomment this line if you want debug messages from LaunchyTomboyPlugin
            # to go to <Launch program dir>\plugins\python\stdout.txt
            #ose['LAUNCHY_TOMBOY_DEBUG'] = '1'
        
            from launchytomboyplugin import Tomboy
        
            launchy.registerPlugin(Tomboy)
            print 'Tomboy plugin registered'
        
        - start or restart Launchy
        
        Environment Variables
        ---------------------
        
        - LAUNCHY_TOMBOY_DEBUG: set to enable debug info in the stdout.txt (see below)
        - TOMBOY_PROGRAM_PATH: set to the full path to Tomboy.exe if your Tomboy install
          is in a non-standard location.
        
        Log Files
        ---------
        
        Keep theses files in mind when trying to troubleshoot problems:
        
        - <Launchy program dir>\\plugins\\python\\stdout.txt
        - <Launchy program dir>\\plugins\\python\\stderr.txt
        
        Using the Plugin
        ----------------
        
        This plugin inserts two static items into the Launchy catalog:
        
        - Tomboy New Note
        - Tomboy Search Notes
        
        It will also index the title of every Tomboy note and make it available as an
        item in the Launchy catalog.  So if you have a note with a title of "ToDo List"
        typing "ToDo List" in Launchy should bring up that item.  Hitting enter will
        open the corresponding Tomboy note.
        
        Note: the plugin rebuilds the list of note titles whenever Launchy rebuilds its
        catalog.  The auto-refresh time period can be set in Launchy options.  A manual
        refresh of the catalog can also be triggered, see Launchy docs for more info.
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        If Tomboy is not running and two Tomboy related commands are issued quickly
        in succession, its possible the second Tomboy instance will crash.  Once Tomboy
        is up and running, this is no longer an issue.
        
        Workaround: be patient the first time you use a Tomboy related item with Launchy
        to give the Tomboy process that is started time to fully initialize.
