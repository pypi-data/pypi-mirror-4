        Mocksey Motivation
        ==================
        
        I was teaching a class on unit testing to a group of co-workers who were familiar with `Simple Test for PHP <http://www.simpletest.org/>`_ so I hacked together what is becoming Mocksey.
        
        Mocksey the TDD'd version of that TDD utilty. `It's so meta even this acronym <http://xkcd.com/917/>`_.
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        It's pretty simple.  Create a mocked object with generate_mock, inject it (or monkey patch) and set up your assertions.  After your function call(s), simply call 'run_asserts' and win!
        
        The unit tests are a pretty decent working example.
