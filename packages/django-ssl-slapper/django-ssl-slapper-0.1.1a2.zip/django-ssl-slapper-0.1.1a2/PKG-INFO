Description: Django SSL Slapper
        ===================
        
        Django django-ssl-slapper is a middleware that allows you to set urls to ssl only.  It can also redirects anonymous users off your https service onto your http.  Logged-in users may also be directed to https.
        
        Decorators are also included that use cache to count the number of login attempts.  Excessive login attempts, for example from computer hackers, temporary lock the login page.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ```pip install django-ssl-slapper```
        
        Add     ```ssl_slapper.middleware.ssl_slapper``` to middleware in your django settings file
        
        
        Securing Views
        --------------
        
        To secure a url simply add it to the list in your settings file.  For example:
        
        Add the decorator to login pages, for example:
            url(r'^account/login/$', \
                decorators.redirect_authenticated_user()(decorators.ratelimit_login()(auth_views.login)), \
                {'template_name': 'registration/login.html'},name='auth_login'),
        
        
        Settings
        --------
        ```SSL_SLAPPER_SSL_ONLY_PAGES = ('/account/login/','/admin/.*')``` Add to this list any pages that you want as ssl.
        
        ```SSL_SLAPPER_SSL_REDIRECT_ANONYMOUS=True```  Set to true to redirect anonymous users to http.
        
        ```SSL_SLAPPER_SSL_REDIRECT_AUTHENTICATED=True```  Set to true to redirect authenticated users to https.
