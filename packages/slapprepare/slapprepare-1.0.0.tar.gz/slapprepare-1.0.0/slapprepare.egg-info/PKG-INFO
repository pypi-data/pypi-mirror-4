        ***********
        
        Slapprepare is the script responsible to prepare a openSUSE computer to run slapos as a dedicated machine.
        
        Process
        -------------------------------------------
        1. Will parse option and set basic parameters
        2. Add slapos repositories with zypper
        3. Install latest version of slapos but will deactivate slapos-node service
            (Wait till everything is ready)
        4. If option --update or -u wasn't choosen slapprepare will consider
           it need to prepare computer like a newborn one
           -It is a first run and ask a few question a user:
             * "Automatically register new computer to Vifib?" (Default is yes)
                is yes choosen two more question will follow:
                "Define a unique name for this computer:"
                	      Unique name to register computer on Vifib Master
                "Number of SlapOS partitions for this computer? Default is 20 :"
                	      Partition amount for this computer
             * "Is this a virtual Machine?" (Default is False)
                 Is it a virtual machine? Default is false
             * If not a virtual machine:
               "Do you want to use SlapOS with a second disk?" (Default is True)
                If True selected the script slapos_firstboot will be run searching
                for second a second disk.
             * "Do you want to use vpn to provide ipv6?" (Default is Yes)
                If False selected will remove openvpn-needed file in config directory
             * "Do you want to force the use lxc on this computer?" (Default is No)
                If Yes choosen will run "# touch /etc/opt/slapos/SlapContainer-needed"
             * "Do you want a remote ssh access?" (Default is Yes)
                If yes is choosen, will later ask for a web address
        	 to download user' public ssh key and put it in root authorized_keys
           -If automatically register to vifib was choosen
             it will run slapos node register which prepare slapos configuration
           -Display computer's reference ("Your Computer is : COMP-1234")
           -If remote ssh access was choosen will ask for public key address
             and download it.
           -Will prepare computer:
           	 * Setting hostname
        	 * Adding the hostname as a valid address
        	 * Creating safe sshd_config
        	 * Creating default bridge config
        	 * If remote ssh: Writing ssh key
        	 * Adding slapos_firstboot in case of MultiDisk usage
           - If multi-disk usage it will run slapos_firstboot and reinstall slapos
        5. It will install boot script that are not included in package
           - Boot script in "/usr/sbin/slapos-boot-dedicated"
             and its associated service in:
                  "/etc/systemd/system/slapos-boot-dedicated.service"
           - clientipv4 (openvpn conf)
           - Remove script form older versions of slapprepare
        6. Configure NTP daemon
        7. "#systemctl enable slapos-boot-dedicated.service"
           "#systemctl start slapos-boot-dedicated.service"
           Will activate an start slapos-boot-dedicated
        
        About slapos-boot-dedicated
        -------------------------------------------
        It is in slapprepare/script/slapos
        
        Process
        +++++++
        1. Deactivate slapos-node.service (daemon from package) to prepare quietly
        2. Check ipv4-ipv6 and start openvpn if needed or asked
        3. Reset root password
        4. Check if slapos is installed (if not reinstall it)
        5. Create PKI repository
        6. If slapos.cfg is not in /etc/opt/slapos/ it correct path in package
            script and cron file
        7. Set dedicated cron file "/etc/cron.d/slapos"
           - If SlapContainer-needed file in configuration directory  will add a line
              to use it
        8. Set various parameters to improve running performance of slapos
        
        
        
        How to update you old Suse Image (Suse 12.1 or sooner)
        ------------------------------------------------------
        Run this whole command as root:
        
        # wget zypper remove -y slapos.node; rm -f /etc/opt/slapos/slapos.node*.rpm; easy_install slapparepare && slapprepare -u ;
        
        
        Check your config
        -------------------------------------------
        Check your config file and your cron file
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        Run:
        # slapos-test
        This script will check your config file for missing section or parameters
        
        You can use the slapos.cfg.example config file as reference for slapos.cfg.
        http://git.erp5.org/gitweb/slapos.core.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/slapos.cfg.example
        
        
        Check dedicated cron file
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++
        # less /etc/cron.d/slapos
        
        It should contain a call to slapupdate
        
        Check your configuration directory
        ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        # ls /etc/opt/slapos/
        
        It should only contain your slapos configuration files and *-needed files
        
        
        Configure your machine:
        -------------------------------------------
        LXC
        ++++
        If you want to run lxc on you machine run these command:
        
        # touch /etc/opt/slapos/SlapContainer-needed ; systemctl restart slapos-boot-dedicated.service
        
        openvpn
        +++++++
        Openvpn by vifib for ipv6 is forced by default in the package.
        - If you want to deactivate it run
        # rm /etc/opt/slapos/openvpn-needed
        
        
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        1.0.0 (2013-03-07)
        ------------------
        
         * Initial stable release!
         * Chown all files in software root and instance root when doing slapprepare.
           It allows easier USB key replacement.
         * Completely disable root password. Won't create random password.
        
        1.0a7 (2013-01-24)
        ------------------
        
         * Fixed a bug where the hostname would contain a newline.
        
        1.0a6 (2013-01-15)
        ------------------
        
         * Machine tweaks: raise max AIO NR and nofile, set semaphore limits. This
           allows to run many instances of apache/mysql/zope on the same machine.
         * Mount /var/log on disk in order not to touch USB key.
         * When running slapupdate, will update slapprepare as well.
         * update crontab so that it calls slapupdate randomly. It means: not all
           nodes in the same timezone will try to update at the same time (thus not
           kill cache system).
        
        1.0a5 (2013-01-07)
        ------------------
        
         * autoupdate through easy_install before running slapprepare
         * Force start of VPN if defined
         * Add limits.conf file preventing fork bombs and ensuring root can spawn lot
           of processes
        
        1.0a4 (2012-11-22)
        ------------------
        
          * Re-release previous version with correct changes.
        
        1.0a3 (2012-11-13)
        ------------------
        
          * Minor release: doesn't show scary error when modprobe of some monitoring
            module can't be done. [Cédric de Saint Martin]
          * Change references of VIFIB to slapos.org.
        
        1.0a2 (2012-11-12)
        ------------------
        
          * Don't crash when we don't want to create slapos.cfg file. [Cédric de Saint
            Martin]
        
        1.0a1 (2012-10-30)
        ------------------
        
          * Initial release on Pypi.
