Description: ===================================================
        ``z3c.rml`` -- An alternative implementation of RML
        ===================================================
        
        This is an alternative implementation of ReportLab's RML PDF generation XML
        format. Like the original implementation, it is based on ReportLab's
        ``reportlab`` library.
        
        You can read all about ``z3c.rml`` and see many examples on how to use it,
        see the "RML Reference":http://svn.zope.org/z3c.rml/trunk/src/z3c/rml/rml-reference.pdf?view=auto

        2.0.0 (2012-12-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented ``saveState`` and ``restoreState`` directives. (LP #666194)
        
        - Implemented ``storyPlace`` directive. (LP #665941)
        
        - Implemented ``clip`` attribute of ``path`` directive. See RML example 041.
        
        - Added ``h4``, ``h5``, and ``h6`` directives.
        
        - Implemented ``codesnippet`` directive.
        
        - Implemented ``pageBreakBefore``, ``frameBreakBefore``, ``textTransform``,
          and ``endDots`` attributes for paragraph styles.
        
        - Added ``maxLineLength`` and ``newLineChars`` attributes to the ``pre``
          directive.
        
        - Implemented ``pageNumber`` element for all ``draw*String`` elements.
        
        - Implemented ``NamedString`` directive.
        
        - Implemented ``startIndex`` and ``showIndex`` directive. Also hooked up
          ``index`` in paragraphs properly. You can now create real book indexes.
        
        - Implemented ``ol``, ``ul``, and ``li`` directives, which allow highly
          flexible lists to be created. Also implemented a complimentary ``listStyle``
          directive.
        
        - Implemented the following doc-programming directives:
        
            * docAssert
            * docAssign
            * docElse
            * docIf
            * docExec
            * docPara
            * docWhile
        
        - Added ``encName`` attribute to ``registerCidFont`` directive.
        
        - Renamed ``bookmark`` to ``bookmarkPage``.
        
        - Created a new canvas directive called ``bookmark``.
        
        - Added ``img`` directive, which is a simple image flowable.
        
        - Implemented crop marks support fully.
        
        - Added ``pageLayout`` and ``pageMode`` to ``docInit`` directive.
        
        - Implemented all logging related directives.
        
        - Implemented ``color`` directive inside the ``initialize`` directive.
        
        - Renamed ``pdfInclude`` to documented ``includePdfPages`` and added `pages`
          attribute, so that you can only include specific pages.
        
        - Don't show "doc" namespace in reference snippets.
        
        - Create a list of RML2PDF and z3c.rml differences.
        
        - Implemented the ``ABORT_ON_INVALID_DIRECTIVE`` flag, that when set ``True``
          will raise a ``ValueError`` error on the first occurence of a bad tag.
        
        - Implemented ``setFontSize`` directive for page drawings.
        
        - Implemented ``plugInGraphic`` which allows inserting graphics rendered in
          Python.
        
        - Added `href` and `destination` to table cells and rectangles.
        
        - Bug: Due to a logic error, bad directives were never properly detected and
          logged about.
        
        - Bug: Overwriting the default paragraph styles did not work properly.
        
        - Bug: Specifying a color in any tag inside the paragraph would fail, if the
          color was a referenced name.
        
        - Bug: Moved premature ``getName`` evaluation into runtime to properly handle
          synamic content now. This is now properly done for any paragraph and
          draw string variant.
        
        - Bug: Fixed DTD generator to properly ignore Text Nodes as attributes. Also
          text nodes were not properly documented as element PCDATA.
        
        
        1.1.0 (2012-12-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgrade to ReportLab 2.6. This required some font changes and several
          generated PDFs did not match, since some default fonts changed to sans-serif.
        
        - Added ``pdfInclude`` directive from Alex Garel. (LP #969399).
        
        - Switched to Pillow (from PIL).
        
        - Switched RML highlighting in RML Reference from SilverCity to Pygments.
        
        - Bug: Addressed a bug in ReportLab 2.6 that disallowed 3-D pie charts from
          rendering.
        
        - Bug: Properly reset pdfform before rendering a document.
        
        - Bug: Reset fonts properly before a rendering.
        
        
        1.0.0 (2012-04-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
          ``zope.testing.doctest``.
        
        
        0.9.1 (2010-07-22)
        ------------------
        
        - I found a more complete paragraph border patch from Yuan Hong. Now the DTD
          is updated, the border supports a border radius and the tag-para.rml sample
          has been updated.
        
        
        0.9.0 (2010-07-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgraded to ReportLab 2.4. This required some font changes and several
          generated PDFs did not match, since some default fonts changed.
        
        - Upgraded to latest lxml. This only required a trivial change. Patch by Felix
          Schwarz.
        
        - Implemented ``linePlot3D`` directive. Patch by Faisal Puthuparackat.
        
        - Added paragraph border support. Patch by Yuan Hong.
        
        - Bug: Fixed version number in reference.pt. Patch by Felix Schwarz.
        
        - Bug: Write PDF documents in binary mode. Patch by Felix Schwarz.
        
        
        0.8.0 (2009-02-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug: Use python executable as a part of the subprocess command.
        
        - Add support for RML's `pageNumber` element.
        
        
        0.7.3 (2007-11-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Make sure that the output dir is included in the distribution.
        
        
        0.7.2 (2007-11-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgraded to work with ReportLab 2.1 and lxml 1.3.6.
        
        - Fix sub-process tests for a pure egg setup.
        
        
        0.7.1 (2007-07-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug: When the specified page size (within the ``pageInfo`` element) was a
          word or set thereof, the processing would fail. Thanks to Chris Zelenak for
          reporting the bug and providing a patch.
        
        
        0.7.0 (2007-06-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Feature: Added a Chinese PDF sample file to ``tests/expected`` under the
          name ``sample-shipment-chinese.pdf``.
        
        - Feature: Added another tag that is commonly needed in projects. The
          ``<keepTogether>`` tag will keep the child flowables in the same frame.
          When necessary, the frame break will be automatic. Patch by Yuan Hong.
        
        - Feature: Added the "alignment" attribute to the ``blockTable``
          directive. This attribute defines the horizontal alignment for a table that
          is not 100% in width of the containing flowable. Patch by Yuan Hong.
        
        - Feature: When creating Chinese PDF documents, the normal TTF for Chinese
          printing is 'simsun'. However, when bold text is neeed, we switch to
          'simhei'. To properly register this, we need the
          ``reportlab.lib.fonts.addMapping`` function. This is missing in the reportlab
          RML specification, so a new directive has been defined::
        
            <addMapping faceName="simsun" bold="1" italic="0" psName="simhei" />
        
          Patch by Yuan Hong.
        
        - Feature: The ``para`` and ``paraStyle`` directive now support the "wordWrap"
          attribute, which allows for selecting a different wrod wrapping
          algorithm. This is needed because some far-East Asian languages do not use
          white space to separate words. Patch by Yuan Hong.
        
        - Bug: Handle Windows drive letters correctly. Report and fix by Yuan Hong.
        
        
        0.6.0 (2007-06-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Bug: Fixed setup.py to include all dependencies.
        
        - Bug: Added test to show that a blocktable style can be applied multiple
          times. A user reported that this is not working, but I could not replicate
          the problem.
        
        - Update: Updated the expected renderings to ReportLab 2.1. There were some
          good layout fixes that broke the image comparison.
        
        
        0.5.0 (2007-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial Release
