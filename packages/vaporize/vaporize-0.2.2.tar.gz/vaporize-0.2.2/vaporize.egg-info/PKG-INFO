Description: Vaporize
        ========
        
        Vaporize is a clean and consistent library for accessing the `Rackspace Cloud API`_.
         
        .. _Rackspace Cloud API: http://docs.rackspace.com/api/
        
        Another One?
        ------------
        
        There are already a number of good Python options out there for accessing the
        Rackspace Cloud API. Unfortunately they have one thing in common: none of them
        use the same pattern. This means a lot of wasted time looking things up in
        the documentation. The other problem is that there is a library for each group
        of sendpoints on the Rackspace cloud API. There's a libarry for CloudServers,
        one for CloudFiles, one for CloudDNS and one for CloudLoadBalancers. Which menas
        there's a lot of redundant code, requiring four imports and four instantiations 
        and it's up to you to smooth over incompatibilities between them.
        
        So Vaporize was born. One library for one API.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install Vaporize using PIP:
        
            pip install vaporize
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Vaporize is designed to be simple to use. Connect to your Rackspace Cloud in
        just two lines of code:
        
            >>> import vaporize
            >>> vaporize.connect('username', 'apikey')
