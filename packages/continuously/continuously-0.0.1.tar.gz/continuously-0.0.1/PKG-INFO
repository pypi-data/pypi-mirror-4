Description: # Continuous
        
        Continuous is a wrapper that allows to invoke a command in *continuous mode*, i.e. to reinvoke it whenever a given files changes.
        Just invoke the command, and wrap the files to be watched in '_'.
        
        Usage example:
        
            > echo "" >hello.txt
            > continuous cat _hello.txt_
            > echo "hello" >>hello.txt
            hello
            > echo "hello again" >>hello.txt
            hello
            hello again
