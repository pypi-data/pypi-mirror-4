Title:  OneShotBlog Sample (Hack) Running

I *finally* got off my ass and put the "OneShotBlog":http://oneshotblog.com/ sample up.
This is the code (plus a few little tweaks) from the sample that is in the "Lamson source":/releases/
running on another server.  It's using all the features of Lamson, include the new "Queue Receiver":/docs/deferred_processing_to_queues.html
functionality.  So far it's working great considering I've just been hacking on it on the side to try
out the usability of the Lamson "APIs":/docs/api/ and not really taken it seriously.

The concept of the oneshotblog is a little weird:

# You send an email to SOMETAG@oneshotblog.com, it can have textile markup.
## SOMETAG can be anything that's a tag (chars, ints, periods, no leading periods), like:  i.want.my.blog@oneshotblog.com
# That is posted for you at http://oneshotblog.com/posts/YOURADDRESS/SOMETAG.html
## I *do* block attempts to use a bad path by whitelisting.  If you send something messed up for the tag it's ignored.
# Then your post is summarized and tossed on the "front page":http://oneshotblog.com/ with the most recent 50 shown.
## This is done by a deferred queue receiver that indexes messages as it receives them.
# If you send to that same tag, it replaces it with the new contents (although the index will show the old stuff for a while).

There's some dumb bugs in it currently, like delete doesn't remove your message from the index and other
fun things, but so far it's running as expected given the work I put into it.

Anyway, feel free to try it out and shoot me feedback.  Try sending really broken email too so that
I can see what Lamson does with it.

h2. Future Features Of OSB

Just for fun I'm gonna clean up OSB and make it official.  I'll add features like commenting on a post via email, each
post is a little mailing list, and handling image and code attachments.  For the code attachments I'll colorize them
with Pygments and put them up with the post.


h2. Mailing Lists and Failmail

I'll be bringing back the mailing list example soon, and I'll also make an address failmail@lamsonproject.org.
More on that later.


h2. Python 2.6 Support

If you're running Python 2.6 then you'll want to wait for the 0.9.3 release later today.  The deployed OSB sample
at "oneshotblog.com":http://oneshotblog.com/ is running on Python 2.6, so I had to fix about 4 failing tests 
regarding unicode issues and weirdness with python-daemonize.
