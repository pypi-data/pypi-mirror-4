Description: ===============================
        Python bindings for WordAi API.
        ===============================
        
        `WordAi <http://wordai.com/index.php>`_ is an online
        service for spinning text (synonym substitution)
        that creates unique version(s) of existing text.
        This package provides a way to easily interact with
        `WordAi API <http://wordai.com/api.php>`_.
        Usage requires an API subscription,
        `get it here <http://wordai.com/pricing.php>`_.
        
        * `Source code @ GitHub <https://github.com/niteoweb/wordai>`_
        
        
        Install within virtualenv
        =========================
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            $ virtualenv foo
            $ cd foo
            $ git clone https://github.com/niteoweb/wordai
            $ bin/pip install wordai/
        
            # running tests:
            $ bin/pip install unittest2 mock
            $ bin/python -m unittest discover -s wordai/src/wordai/tests

            $ bin/python bootstrap.py
            $ bin/buildout
        
            # running tests and check code for imperfections
            $ ./pre-commit-hook.sh

            # from wordai.regular import RegularWordAi as WordAi
            >>> from wordai.turing import TuringWordAi as WordAi
            >>> wai = WordAi('demo@demo.com', 'demo')
