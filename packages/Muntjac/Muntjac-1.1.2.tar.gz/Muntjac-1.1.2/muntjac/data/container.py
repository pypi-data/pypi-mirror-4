"""A specialized set of identified Items."""


class IContainer(object):
    """A specialized set of identified Items. Basically the IContainer is a set
    of L{Item}s, but it imposes certain constraints on its contents. These
    constraints state the following:

      - All Items in the IContainer must have the same number of Properties.
      - All Items in the IContainer must have the same Property ID's (see
        L{Item.getItemPropertyIds}).
      - All Properties in the Items corresponding to the same Property ID must
        have the same data type.
      - All Items within a container are uniquely identified by their non-null
        IDs.

    The IContainer can be visualized as a representation of a relational
    database table. Each Item in the IContainer represents a row in the table,
    and all cells in a column (identified by a Property ID) have the same data
    type. Note that as with the cells in a database table, no Property in a
    IContainer may be empty, though they may contain C{None} values.

    Note that though uniquely identified, the Items in a IContainer are not
    necessarily L{IOrdered} or L{IIndexed indexed}.

    Containers can derive Item ID's from the item properties or use other,
    container specific or user specified identifiers.

    If a container is L{filtered<IFilterable>} or L{sorted<ISortable>},
    most of the the methods of the container interface and its subinterfaces
    (container size, L{containsId}, iteration and indices etc.)
    relate to the filtered and sorted view, not to the full container contents.
    See individual method doc-strings for exceptions to this (adding and
    removing items).

    The IContainer interface is split to several subinterfaces so that a class
    can implement only the ones it needs.

    When a set of filters are set, only items that match all the filters are
    included in the visible contents of the container. Still new items that
    do not match filters can be added to the container. Multiple filters can
    be added and the container remembers the state of the filters. When
    multiple filters are added, all filters must match for an item to be
    visible in the container.

    When an L{IOrdered} or L{IIndexed} container is filtered, all
    operations of these interfaces should only use the filtered contents and
    the filtered indices to the container.

    How filtering is performed when a L{IHierarchical} container
    implements L{ISimpleFilterable} is implementation specific and should
    be documented in the implementing class.

    Adding items (if supported) to a filtered L{IOrdered} or
    L{IIndexed} container should insert them immediately after the
    indicated visible item. The unfiltered position of items added at index
    0, at index L{IContainer.size} or at an undefined position is up to the
    implementation.

    The functionality of ISimpleFilterable can be implemented using the
    L{IFilterable} API and L{SimpleStringFilter}.
