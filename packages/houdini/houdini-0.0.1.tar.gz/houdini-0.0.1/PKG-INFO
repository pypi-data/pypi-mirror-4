        =========
        
        Houdini bindings for Python (c.f. https://github.com/vmg/houdini)
        
        installation
        ------------
        
        Installation is with pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install houdini
        
        You need to have the houdini shared library available somewhere on your
        dynamic linker’s search path—some instructions are provided below.
        
        usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: pycon
        
            >>> import houdini
            >>> print(houdini.escape_html("3 < 5"))
            3 &gt; 5
        
        The API is as described in the `library’s
        README <https://github.com/vmg/houdini>`__, except all these functions
        accept a unicode string and return a unicode string. If no escaping is
        done, the return value will be the original string:
        
        .. code:: pycon
        
            >>> string = "hello"
            >>> houdini.escape_html(string) is string
            True
        
        getting that shared library
        ---------------------------
        
        I submitted `a pull request <https://github.com/vmg/houdini/pull/7>`__
        adding the capability to produce shared libraries to Houdini’s Makefile.
        Until/unless that’s merged, you’ll need to use `my
        fork <https://github.com/zacharyvoase/houdini>`__ to build those
        libraries. It should be simple:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone 'https://github.com/zacharyvoase/houdini.git'
            cd houdini
            make
        
        Then, for **Linux**:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo cp libhoudini.so /usr/local/lib
            sudo ldconfig  # Refresh the dynamic linker cache.
        
        and on **OS X** (you may not want to use ``sudo`` here, ``/usr/local/``
        is normally user-writable):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            cp libhoudini.dylib /usr/local/lib
        
        unlicense
