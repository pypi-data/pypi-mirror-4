Sumatra: automated tracking of scientific computations
======================================================

Sumatra is a tool for managing and tracking projects based on numerical
simulation and/or analysis, with the aim of supporting reproducible research.
It can be thought of as an automated electronic lab notebook for computational
projects.

It consists of:

* a command-line interface, *smt*, for launching simulations/analyses with
  automatic recording of information about the experiment, annotating these
  records, linking to data files, etc.
* a web interface with a built-in web-server, *smtweb*, for browsing and
  annotating simulation/analysis results.
* a Python API, on which smt and smtweb are based, that can be used in your own
  scripts in place of using smt, or could be integrated into a GUI-based
  application.

Sumatra is currently beta code, and should be used with caution and frequent
backups of your records.
