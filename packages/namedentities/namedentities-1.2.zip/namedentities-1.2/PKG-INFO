Description: Named HTML entities are much neater and much
        easier to comprehend than numeric entities. And because they
        fall within the ASCII range, they're 
        much safer
        to use in multiple contexts
        than Unicode and its various encodings (UTF-8 and such).
        
        This
        module helps convert from numerical HTML entites and Unicode characters that
        fall outside the normal ASCII range into named entities.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Python 2::
          
            from namedentities import named_entities
            
            u = u'both em\u2014and&#x2013;dashes&hellip;'
            print named_entities(u)
            
        yields::
        
            both em&mdash;and&ndash;dashes&hellip;
            
        Python 3::
        
            from namedentities import named_entities
            
            u = 'both em\u2014and&#x2013;dashes&hellip;'
            print(named_entities(u))
            # same result
        
        Or using the `six <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`_ cross-version compatibility
        library, either one::
        
            from namedentities import named_entities
            import six
            
            u = six.u('both em\u2014and&#x2013;dashes&hellip;')
            six.print_(named_entities(u))
            # same result
        
        Recent Changes
        ==============
         
         * Now
           successfully packaged for, and tests against, against Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
           
         * Commenced automated multi-version testing with
           `pytest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_
           and `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_.
           
        Notes
        =====
           
         * Doesn't attempt to encode ``&lt;``, ``&gt;``, or 
           ``&amp;`` (or their numerical equivalents) to avoid
           interfering with HTML escaping.
        
         * This is basically a packaging of `Ian Beck's work
           <http://beckism.com/2009/03/named_entities_python/>`_. Thank you, Ian!
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install namedentities
        
        To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::
        
            python3.3 -m easy_install namedentities
            
        (You may need to prefix these with "sudo " to authorize installation.)
