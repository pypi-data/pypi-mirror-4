.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
add\-job\-flow\-steps adds new steps to a running job flow. A maximum of 256 steps
are allowed in each job flow.
.sp
If your job flow is long\-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex, you
may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass the
256\-step limitation in various ways, including using the SSH shell to connect to
the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on the
master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For more information on how to do this, go
to \fI\%Add More than 256 --steps to a Job Flow\fP in the \fIAmazon
Elastic MapReduce Developer\(aqs Guide\fP .
.sp
A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the master node of
the job flow or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by the main function of the
main class of the JAR file. The main class can be specified either in the
manifest of the JAR or by using the MainFunction parameter of the step.
.sp
Elastic MapReduce executes each step in the order listed. For a step to be
considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero exit code and all
Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must have completed and run
successfully.
.sp
You can only add steps to a job flow that is in one of the following states:
STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.
