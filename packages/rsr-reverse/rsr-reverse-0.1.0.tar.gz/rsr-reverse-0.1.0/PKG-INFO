        ===
        
        RSR Reverse stands for Rails-Syle Route Reverse.  It reverses Rails-style routes.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Beside routing, one of the most basic needs of a web framework is to reverse routes--either for embedding in generated content or for server-side redirection.
