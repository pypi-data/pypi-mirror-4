    The visible component consists of a file name input box and a browse
    button and an upload submit button to start uploading.

    The Upload component needs a StringIO to write the uploaded
    data. You need to implement the upload.IReceiver interface and return the
    output stream in the receiveUpload() method.

    You can get an event regarding starting (StartedEvent), progress
    (ProgressEvent), and finishing (FinishedEvent) of upload by implementing
    IStartedListener, IProgressListener, and IFinishedListener, respectively.
    The IFinishedListener is called for both failed and succeeded uploads. If
    you wish to separate between these two cases, you can use
    ISucceededListener (SucceededEvenet) and IFailedListener (FailedEvent).

    The upload component does not itself show upload progress, but you can use
    the ProgressIndicator for providing progress feedback by implementing
    IProgressListener and updating the indicator in updateProgress().

    Setting upload component immediate initiates the upload as soon as a file
    is selected, instead of the common pattern of file selection field and
    upload button.

    Note! Because of browser dependent implementations of <input type="file">
    element, setting size for Upload component is not supported. For some
    browsers setting size may work to some extent.
