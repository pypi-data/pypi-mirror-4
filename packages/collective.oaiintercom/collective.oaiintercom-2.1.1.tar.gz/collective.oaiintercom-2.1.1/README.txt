Introduction
============

collective.oaiintercom is a product that extends a Plone site to 
enable it to provide OAI-PMH metadata harvesting capabilites
(http://www.openarchives.org/pmh). It provides metadtata information in 
service requests to a Service Provider via the OAI-PMH v2.0 protocol 
specification.

Metadata requests are provided through a top level view (/oai) and must
follow the conventions listed in the specification (http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html).

Once you have enabled this product you can test your Plone site using the 
Repository Explorer (http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/).
