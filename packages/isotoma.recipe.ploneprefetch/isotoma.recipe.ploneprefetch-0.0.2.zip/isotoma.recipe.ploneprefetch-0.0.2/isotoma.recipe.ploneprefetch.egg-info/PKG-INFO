Description: isotoma.recipe.ploneprefetch
        ============================
        
        This recipe prefetches all the Plone eggs contained in a unified installer.
        This vastly reduces the number of eggs that have to be installed giving Travis
        a chance of actually building your code before hitting a timeout.
        
        Just do::
        
            [prefetch]
            recipe = isotoma.recipe.ploneprefetch
            url = http://launchpad.net/plone/4.1/4.1/+download/Plone-4.1-UnifiedInstaller-20110907.tgz
            python = 2.6
        
        The python version is just to stop a python 2.6 user from downloading the
        unified installer for plone 4.2 which is 2.7 only. It's optional.
