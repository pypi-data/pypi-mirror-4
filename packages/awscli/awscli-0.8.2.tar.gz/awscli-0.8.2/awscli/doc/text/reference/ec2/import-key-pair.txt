import-key-pair
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Imports the public key from an RSA key pair created with a third-party
tool. This operation differs from  create-key-pair as the private key
is never transferred between the caller and AWS servers.

RSA key pairs are easily created on Microsoft Windows and Linux OS
systems using the "ssh-keygen" command line tool provided with the
standard OpenSSH installation. Standard library support for RSA key
pair creation is also available for Java, Ruby, Python, and many other
programming languages.

The following formats are supported:

* OpenSSH public key format,

* Base64 encoded DER format.

* SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716 .
