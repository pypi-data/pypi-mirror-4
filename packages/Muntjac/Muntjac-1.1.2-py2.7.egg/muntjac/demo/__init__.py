"""Provides several fully functional Muntjac example applications. These
highlight certain aspects of the Muntjac and how it can be
used to produce simple, elegant yet powerful user interface driven
applications.

  - B{HelloWorld} is the classic example which only prints the
    text "Hello, World!" on the screen.
  - B{Calc} implements a calculator application which demonstrates
    how to build a bit more complicated user interface and how the
    application can interact with the user through that interface.
