    VECPERM    Vec-permutation matrix.
           VECPERM(M, N) is the vec-permutation matrix, an MN-by-MN
           permutation matrix P with the property that if A is M-by-N then
           vec(A) = P*vec(A').
           If N is omitted, it defaults to M.

           P is formed by taking every n'th row from EYE(M*N), starting with
           the first and working down - see p. 277 of the reference.
