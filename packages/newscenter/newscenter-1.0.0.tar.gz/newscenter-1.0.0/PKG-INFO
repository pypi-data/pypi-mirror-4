Description: ==========
        Newscenter
        ==========
        
        A Django application for creating news releases which can be associated with unique newsroom objects.
        
        A Django CMS apphook is included as well as a templatetag for rendering news release headlines in non-application templates.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        #. Add newscenter to your python path
        #. Add the following to the INSTALLED_APPS of your project's settings.py::
        	'newscenter',
        #. In your urls.py, add
        	(r'^news/', include('newscenter.urls')),
        #. Run::
        	manage.py syncdb
        	manage.py collectstatic
        #. Load the initial newsroom object from the newscenter fixtures directory:
        	manage.py loaddata newscenter/fixtures/newsroom.json. 
           This has not been called initial_data.json because we want it to be editable and not reset every time syncdb is run.
