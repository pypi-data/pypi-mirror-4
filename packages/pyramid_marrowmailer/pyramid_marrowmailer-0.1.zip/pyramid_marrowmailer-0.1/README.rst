Pyramid integration package for "A highly efficient and modular mail delivery
framework for Python 2.6+ and 3.1+, formerly TurboMail."

Currently it must be used with `pyramid_tm`, as `Mailer.send` only works
if `transaction`.commit() succeeded.

INSTALL
=======

::

    $ env/bin/easy_install pyramid_marrowmailer


USAGE
=====

If you have package installed, you can configure it in Pyramid like always::

    config.include('pyramid_marrowmailer')

All settings `marrow.mailer` expects are prefixed with `mail.`. If you want
to use different prefix, set it with `pyramid_marrowmailer.prefix`.

To see what options `marrow.mailer` support, see
`the documentation <https://github.com/marrow/marrow.mailer>`_. Note that
boolean options need a `.on` suffix. For example `mail.transport.debug.on = true`.
Options that need to be converted to integer, add `int` suffix. For example
`mail.transport.port.int = 1337`.

`pyramid_marrowmailer` calls `Mailer.start` when `config.include('pyramid_marrowmailer')`
is called. `atexit` is used to register `Mailer.stop` to shutdown when wsgi server will exit.

Note that `pyramid_marrowmailer` subclasses `marrow.mailer.Mailer` to provide support for
`transaction`. Class is importable from `pyramid_marrowmailer.TransactionMailer`

You can accces `pyramid_marrowmailer.TransactionMailer` instance in two ways::

    mailer = request.mailer
    message = mailer.new()
    message.send()


Or::
    
    from pyramid_marrowmailer import get_mailer
    mailer = get_mailer(request)
    message = mailer.new()
    message.send()


EXAMPLE
=======

If we have paster `.ini` something like::

    mail.transport.use = smtp
    mail.message.author = foobar@foo.com


Inside a view, we can do::

    mailer = request.mailer
    message = mailer.new()
    message.subject = "foobar2"
    message.to = "foobar2@bar.com"
    message.plain = "hi"
    message.send()


TESTING
=======

::

    $ pip install nose coverage pep8 setuptools-flakes
    $ ./pre-commit-check.sh


TODO
====

- Add support to use `marrow.mailer` without usage of `transaction`
