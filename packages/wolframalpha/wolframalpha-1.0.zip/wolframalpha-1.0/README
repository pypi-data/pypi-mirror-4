wolframalpha
============

Python Client built against the `Wolfram|Alpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_
v2.0 API.

Usage
=====

Basic usage is pretty simple. Create the client with your App ID (request from
Wolfram Alpha)::

    import wolframalpha
    client = wolframalpha.Client(app_id)

Then, you can send queries, which return Result objects::

    res = client.query('temperature in Washington, DC on October 3, 2012')

Result objects have `pods` attribute (a Pod is an answer from Wolfram Alpha).
You may also query for simple the pods which have 'Result' titles::

    print(res.results[0].text)
