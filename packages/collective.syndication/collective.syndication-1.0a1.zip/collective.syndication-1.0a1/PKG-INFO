        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ----------------------------------
        
        ``collective.syndication`` improves standard syndication on Plone sites by
        providing 4 feed types: `RSS 1.0`_, `RSS 2.0`_, `Atom`_ and iTunes.
        
        This package is a backport for Plone 4.1 and 4.2 of `Nathan Van Gheem`_'s
        `Improved Syndication`_ PLIP implementation made for Plone 4.3.
        
        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        Atom
        ^^^^
        
        Atom is an XML-based document format that describes lists of related
        information known as "feeds". Feeds are composed of a number of items, known
        as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached metadata. For example,
        each entry has a title.
        
        The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web content
        such as weblogs and news headlines to Web sites as well as directly to user
        agents.
        
        Atom feeds have multiple `advantages`_ over RSS feeds.
        
        iTunes
        ^^^^^^
        
        TBD.
        
        NewsML
        ^^^^^^
        
        TBD.
        
        RSS 1.0 (RDF Site Summary)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        RDF Site Summary is a lightweight multipurpose extensible metadata description
        and syndication format. RSS is an XML application, conforms to the W3C's RDF
        Specification and is extensible via XML-namespace and/or RDF based
        modularization.
        
        RSS 2.0
        ^^^^^^^
        
        TBD.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.syndication`` to the list
           of eggs to install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.syndication
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.syndication`` and click the 'Activate'
        button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
