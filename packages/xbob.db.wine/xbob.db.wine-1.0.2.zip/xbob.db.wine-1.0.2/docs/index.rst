==================
 Bob Wine Dataset
==================

The Wine data set is a multivariate dataset introduced by M. Forina et al.
These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the 
same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The 
analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of 
the three types of wines. It is hence often used for classification although
it is not very challenging.
