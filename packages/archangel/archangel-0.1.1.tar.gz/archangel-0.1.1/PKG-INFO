Description: Archangel
        =========
        Archangel is a webserver designed to be fast and easy to use for personal 
        usage. It was created to replace an internal webserver based off of flup for 
        fcgi and wsgiref for http serving (basically anything would be an improvement) as 
        well as explore the new pep-3156_/Tulip_ based library by Guido van Rossum
        
        Archangel is designed to be 'fast'. This does not mean however that archangel 
        is fast, Archangel is instead intended to explore how fast a server using an 
        event loop based of tulip can be made to go and what is needed to get it there.
        
        As an additional side effect it should serve as a light house in the fog as to 
        what you should or should not do with Tulip_ (Of course it is still yet to be 
        determine on which side of the divide Archangel ends up)
        
        Tenets:
        --------
        Only do things when we need to:
            Do things "Just in Time"
        Only do things we have to:
            Be lazy
        Do it quickly:
            Go back to sleep as fast as possible
        
        WSGI-STREAM
        ------------
        Archangel also provides a test-bed for developing a new protocol loosely based 
        off of pep-3333_ but designed for the needs of streaming and for use with 
        tulip_. Due to the use of the ``yield from`` construct by tulip_ compatible 
        event loops, using yield to incrementaly return a body is not possible. As 
        such, an alternate interface is needed to support both writing the body as one 
        whole chunk and iteratively generating the body as well as providing 
        compatibility with the ideas of WSGI for 'wrapping' apps in middleware. At this 
        time (version 0.1) file like proxies are being used for both the request and 
        the response that can be 'corked' or paused until ``start_response`` has been 
        called, preserving a similar interface to WSGI and allowing a WSGI-STREAM 
        middleware to fully emulate a WSGI middleware interface
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        * Python 3.3 or greater
        * Distutils2 (to replace setup.py, a fallback is provided)
        * A copy of the Tulip_ library
        * PyYaml for parsing the config files
