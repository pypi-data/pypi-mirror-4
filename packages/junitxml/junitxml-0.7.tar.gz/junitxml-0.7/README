Usage
-----

To use PyJUnitXML you need to specify it as your ``TestResult`` when running
your tests using pyunit. One way of doing this is to invoke the ``test`` method
directly on your test suite::

 >>> import junitxml
 >>> result = junitxml.JUnitXmlResult(sys.stdout)
 >>> result.startTestRun()
 >>> suite.run(result)
 >>> result.stopTestRun()

The ``startTestRun`` and ``stopTestRun`` methods are new in python 2.7 and 3.1.
If you are using older versions of python, and do not invoke the test result
directly, you may find that no output occurs at all. This is likely because the
``stopTestRun`` method is not being invoked, and you will need to arrange for it
to be invoked.

There is a command line runner you can use::

  $ python -m junitxml.main discover

or

  $ junitxml discover

If the package scripts have been installed.

Troubleshooting
---------------

My test runs, but nothing is output? Check that ``result.stopTestRun`` is being
called. Due to the XML file format requiring a header containing the test
counts, nothing is output until the test run has completed, and that is 
signalled by the ``stopTestRun`` method being called.

Reporting Bugs and Asking Questions
-----------------------------------

PyJUnitXML is hosted on Launchpad at https://launchpad.net/pyjunitxml. Please
file bugs, ask questions and so on at will.

Running PyJUnitXML's test suite
-------------------------------

The function junitxml.test_suite defines the junitxml test suite, you can use
any runner you like. I personally use::

 $ python -m subunit.run junitxml.test_suite | subunit2gtk

If you have testrepository you can simply run testr::

 $ testr run
