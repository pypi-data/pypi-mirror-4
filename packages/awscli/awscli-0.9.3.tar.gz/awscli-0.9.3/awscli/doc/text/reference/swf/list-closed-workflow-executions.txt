list-closed-workflow-executions
*******************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns a list of closed workflow executions in the specified --domain
that meet the filtering criteria. The results may be split into
multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again
using the --next-page-token returned by the initial call.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Constrain the following parameters by using a "Condition" element
  with the appropriate keys.

* "tag" : String constraint. The key is "swf:tagFilter.tag" .

* "typeFilter.name" : String constraint. String constraint. The key is
  "swf:typeFilter.name" .

* "typeFilter.version" : String constraint. String constraint. The key
  is "swf:typeFilter.version" .

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS

     --domain <value>
     [--next-page-token <value>]
     [--maximum-page-size <value>]
     [--type-filter <value>]
     [--execution-filter <value>]
     [--close-time-filter <value>]

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The name of the --domain that contains the workflow executions to
   list.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--next-page-token"  (string)
   If on a previous call to this method a "NextPageToken" was
   returned, the results are being paginated. To get the next page of
   results, repeat the call with the returned token and all other
   arguments unchanged.

"--maximum-page-size"  (integer)
   The maximum number of results returned in each page. The default is
   100, but the caller can override this value to a page size
   *smaller* than the default. You cannot specify a page size greater
   than 100. Note that the number of executions may be less than the
   maxiumum page size, in which case, the returned page will have
   fewer results than the --maximum-page-size specified.

"--type-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only executions of the type specified in the filter
   are returned.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "version"  (string)

   "name"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "version": "string",
        "name": "string"
      }

"--execution-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions matching the workflow id
   specified in the filter are returned.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "workflow_id"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "workflow_id": "string"
      }

"--close-time-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, the workflow executions are included in the returned
   results based on whether their close times are within the range
   specified by this filter. Also, if this parameter is specified, the
   returned results are ordered by their close times.

   Note: "--start-time-filter" and "--close-time-filter" are mutually
     exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not
     both.

   "oldest_date"  (timestamp)

   "latest_date"  (timestamp)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "oldest_date": timestamp,
        "latest_date": timestamp
      }

"--reverse-order"  (boolean)
   When set to "true" , returns the results in reverse order. By
   default the results are returned in descending order of the start
   or the close time of the executions.

"--close-status-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions that match this *close
   status* are listed. For example, if TERMINATED is specified, then
   only TERMINATED workflow executions are listed.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "status"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "status": "COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"CANCELED"|"TERMINATED"|"CONTINUED_AS_NEW"|
        "TIMED_OUT"
      }

"--start-time-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, the workflow executions are included in the returned
   results based on whether their start times are within the range
   specified by this filter. Also, if this parameter is specified, the
   returned results are ordered by their start times.

   Note: "--start-time-filter" and "--close-time-filter" are mutually
     exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not
     both.

   "oldest_date"  (timestamp)

   "latest_date"  (timestamp)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "oldest_date": timestamp,
        "latest_date": timestamp
      }

"--tag-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only executions that have the matching tag are
   listed.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "tag"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "tag": "string"
      }
