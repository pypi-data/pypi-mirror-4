Description: ========================
        NutJob Nutcracker Client
        ========================
        
        The NutJob client is an alternate Redis client based on
        ``redis.StrictRedis``.  It is meant for use with Turnstile, in
        conjunction with the Redis proxy nutcracker, aka twemproxy.  Certain
        functionality which is unsupported by nutcracker is overridden in
        NutJob, either to disable it (such as Turnstile's ``PUBLISH`` to
        report errors) or to replace it with equivalent functionality (such as
        the ``register_script()`` call used by the Turnstile compactor
        daemon).
        
        NutJob is really only intended for use with Turnstile; it is not meant
        as a general-purpose Redis/nutcracker client.
        
        How to Use
        ==========
        
        To use NutJob, add the following configuration settings to the
        appropriate sections of your Turnstile configuration::
        
            [redis]
            redis_client = nutjob
            server_version = <see text>
            host = <nutcracker IP>
        
            [control]
            redis_client = redis
            server_version =
            host = <Redis server IP>
        
        Note the overrides in the ``[control]`` section, particularly the
        explicitly empty value of ``server_version``: the Turnstile control
        daemon MUST be configured to use the standard Redis client and to
        connect to an actual Redis server; the control daemon relies on
        functionality that nutcracker does not support.
        
        As for the ``server_version`` value in the ``[redis]`` section: this
        value is optional, but if set, it should be the minimum server version
        of the Redis servers connected behind the nutcracker proxy.  This
        information is used by the Turnstile compactor daemon to enable an
        optimization; normally, the compactor daemon determines whether to use
        this optimization based on the server version reported by the Redis
        server itself, but nutcracker does not support this version retrieval,
        and so NutJob provides this ``server_version`` side channel to allow
        its use.
