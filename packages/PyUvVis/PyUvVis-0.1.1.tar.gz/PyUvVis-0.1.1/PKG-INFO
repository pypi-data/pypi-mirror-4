        pyuvvis: Tools for explorative spectroscopy

        What is it
        ==========
        
        **pyuvvis** is a set of wrappers and tools written using the pandas_ library
        with the intention of exploring spectral data, especially UV-Vis spectroscopy.

        Goals and Background
        ====================
        
        ``pyuvvis`` originally began at the George Washington University in an 
        effort to develop exploratory and visualization techniques with UvVis
        data, particularly the output of fiberoptic/nanotechnology research. 
        
        The decision to officialy package these nascent tools was made for the following 
        reasons:
         
           1. To faciliate easier sharing and better organization between collaborators.
           2. To document the progress and functionalities of the toolset.
           3. To broadcast the toolkit to the community, and hopefully to merge with other Python spectroscopy packages.
        
        In regard to the final point, ``pyuvvis`` is not an attempt to be the de-facto spectroscopy
        toolkit in Python; rather, it is a domain-specific wrapper for pandas.  It should be quite extensible
        to other spectroscopy domains, where it may perform a supporting or ancillary role.  It is our 
        hope that in the future, other internal GWU tools for fiber optics design and nanomaterial plasmonics,
        combined with this package, may form the basis for a crude nano-optics Python package.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        In the ``pyuvvis`` directory (same one where you found this file), execute::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        See http://hugadams.github.com/pyuvvis/ for additional help.
