Multiple WSGI applications within Zope 3
----------------------------------------

If you wanted to host *more* than one WSGI application there are a
couple ways of doing it:

1. Using a *composite application* as described in PasteDeploy_.

2. Setting up extra `IServerType` utilities.

I'm going to show you how to do the latter now.

The trick here is that you have the option to use both the `zserver`
and the `twisted` WSGI servers. `zope.paste` is just glue code, so we
defined a `IServerType` utility for each, and the only thing special
is that the utility name is passed on to the WSGI application factory.

Here's an excerpt from the `configure.zcml` as found on this package::

  <configure zcml:condition="have zserver">
    <utility
        name="Paste.Main"
        component="._server.http"
        provides="zope.app.server.servertype.IServerType"
        />
  </configure>

  <configure zcml:condition="have twisted">
    <utility
        name="Paste.Main"
        component="._twisted.http"
        provides="zope.app.twisted.interfaces.IServerType"
        />
  </configure>

Depending on which server is available, the right `IServerType`
utility is registered. You are encouraged to use the same pattern when
defining yours.

So suppose you want to have a second WSGI application. Here's how you
could do it.

1. Create a new `IServerType` utility. This excerpt could be added to
   a `configure.zcml` in your own package, or to a standalone file in
   `etc/package_includes`::

    <configure zcml:condition="have zserver">
      <utility
          name="Paste.Another"
          component="zope.paste._server.http"
          provides="zope.app.server.servertype.IServerType"
          />
    </configure>

    <configure zcml:condition="have twisted">
      <utility
          name="Paste.Another"
          component="zope.paste._twisted.http"
          provides="zope.app.twisted.interfaces.IServerType"
          />
    </configure>

2. Change your `zope.conf` file to define a new server, using the
   newly-created `Paste.Another` utility::

     <server>
       type Paste.Main
       address 8080
     </server>

     <server>
       type Paste.Another
       address 8180
     </server>

3. Define a WSGI application `Paste.Another` in `paste.ini`::

     [pipeline:Paste.Main]
     pipeline = xslt main

     [app:main]
     paste.app_factory = zope.paste.application:zope_publisher_app_factory

     [filter:xslt]
     paste.filter_factory = xslfilter:filter_factory

     [app:Paste.Another]
     paste.app_factory = zope.paste.application:zope_publisher_app_factory
