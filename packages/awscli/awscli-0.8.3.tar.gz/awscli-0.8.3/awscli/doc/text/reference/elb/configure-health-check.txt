**********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Enables the client to define an application healthcheck for the
instances.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws elb configure-health-check
     --health-check <value>
     --load-balancer-name <value>


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--health-check"  (structure)
   A structure containing the configuration information for the new
   healthcheck.

   "healthy_threshold"  (integer)
      Specifies the number of consecutive health probe successes
      required before moving the instance to the *Healthy* state.

   "interval"  (integer)
      Specifies the approximate interval, in seconds, between health
      checks of an individual instance.

   "target"  (string)
      Specifies the instance being checked. The protocol is either
      TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, or SSL. The range of valid ports is one (1)
      through 65535.

      Note: TCP is the default, specified as a TCP: port pair, for example
        "TCP:5000". In this case a healthcheck simply attempts to open
        a TCP connection to the instance on the specified port.
        Failure to connect within the configured timeout is considered
        unhealthy.SSL is also specified as SSL: port pair, for
        example, SSL:5000.For HTTP or HTTPS protocol, the situation is
        different. You have to include a ping path in the string. HTTP
        is specified as a HTTP:port;/;PathToPing; grouping, for
        example "HTTP:80/weather/us/wa/seattle". In this case, a HTTP
        GET request is issued to the instance on the given port and
        path. Any answer other than "200 OK" within the timeout period
        is considered unhealthy.The total length of the HTTP ping
        target needs to be 1024 16-bit Unicode characters or less.

   "timeout"  (integer)
      Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, during which no
      response means a failed health probe.

      Note: This value must be less than the *Interval* value.

   "unhealthy_threshold"  (integer)
      Specifies the number of consecutive health probe failures
      required before moving the instance to the *Unhealthy* state.

   *Parameter Syntax*
