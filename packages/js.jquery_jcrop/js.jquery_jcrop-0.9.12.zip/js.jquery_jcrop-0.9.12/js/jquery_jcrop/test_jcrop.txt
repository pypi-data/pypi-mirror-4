Usage
=====

You can import ``jquery_jcrop`` from ``js.jquery_jcrop`` and ``need`` it where
you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.jquery_jcrop import jquery_jcrop
  >>> jquery_jcrop.need()

and this will automatically include all the jCrop CSS and JavaScript resources
for you.  We also provide a minified version of the resources for when
you want to move your code into production and reduce page weight.  These
latter libraries are automagically included for you thanks to Fanstatic when
you turn on minification.
