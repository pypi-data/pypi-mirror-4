# Acrylamid Changelog

Version 0.5
-----------

Released on January, 20th 2013 – Winter Is Coming!

### What is new?

- speed improvements (up to 25%) due new internal hash (Adler32 vs. MD5)
  and detection of changes in your configuration, environment and posts.
- #7 –  static site search backend (not yet integrated into any theme, still
  waiting for a new default theme based on `syte`. The static site search is
  documented in docs/ and Acrylamid ships a python script to query the index.
- multiple views per rule! So, in theory you can map pages, posts, drafts
  and translations to `/:slug/`.
- #95 – add "read more" support for intro filter (Alexander Zhirov)
- #90 – specify alternate configuration file via `--conf /path/to/conf.py`
- #87 – new reStructuredText directive for Vimeo (the\_metalgamer)
- #82 – updated Atom feed to include tags, icon and provides a unique id for
  multiple destinations (Mark van Lent)
- improved WordPress import (pages and draft recognition)
- integrated web server blocks browser requests during (auto) compilation
- #78 – `acrylamid import` now uses RSS/Atom categories as tags
- #80 – new config variable `CONTENT_EXTENSION` to set the default filename
  extension when using `acrylamid new`, defaults to `.txt` (Günter Kolousek)
- new asset writer: `Jinja2` for the `.html` extension
- new filter: `intro` shows up to N paragraphs (`<p>...</p>`).

### What changes?

- `env.views` is now a list containing the actual view objects, but retains
  `if 'sitemap' in env.views` and `env.views['sitemap']` syntax.
- entry view no longer generates drafts. This might break your `conf.py`. To
  enable drafts, replace `"view": "entry"` with `"views": ["entry", "draft"]`
  inside your `"/:year/:slug/"` view.
- relative URIs in feeds are now absolute per default. URI fragments such as
  `#fn:1` are now distinct (relative to `WWW_ROOT`) in the index and tag view.
  To change this behavior, add `norelative` and `noabsolute` to the affected views.
- SASS/SCSS and LESS conversion are no longer in Acrylamid's defaults (if
  available), hence you have to include them via `STATIC_FILTERS += ['SASS', ...]`

### What was fixed?

- compatibility with python 3.2 is now assured by the testsuite
- auto compilation gets slower for each iteration
- #95 – fix assets not being copied when multiple directories (Christoph Polcin)
- #94 – more accurate intro generation (Alexander Zhirov)
- #73 – LESS and SASS conversion is now optional
- #67 – track referenced entries for updates
- #86 – escape YAML blocks ("[" and "]") properly
- #85 – empty posts in WordPress dump broke the import
- #84 – TypeError in the second run during auto compilation
- #82 – theme files copied to output if they are not used
- #77 – missing items in sitemap view
- #75 – dotfiles not copied from the static folder (Mark van Lent)
