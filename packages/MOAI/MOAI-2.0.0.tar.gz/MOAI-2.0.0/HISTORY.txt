  smaller simpler codebase, pluggability through entry_points instead of ZCA.

- Update mods format and support for EU GAL metadata MODS extension
- Several documentation and tool improvements by Filipe Correia

Changes
~~~~~~~

MOAI 1.1.1 (2010-09-02)
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Fixed ID/IDref attributes in MODS format
- Fixed ZeroDivisionError in progressbar drawing of updatedb script

MOAI 1.1.0 (2010-04-08)
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Added new config option `deleted_sets` which can be used to make all 
  resources within a specific set `oai deleted` within the context of a 
  specific feed. In many cases this is preferable compared to `disallowed_sets`
  since resources will just dissapear when they are not allowed without
  leaving a proper deleted resource behind.
- Disable ranged HTTP requests in Apache mod_python backend. This was giving
  problems with acrobat plugin and its "Fast Web View" feature.
- Show records sorted on descending datestamp, instead of ascending record id,
  in sqlite backend.

MOAI 1.0.9 (2010-02-16)
-----------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

  This prevents the OAI server from crashing on invalid data. 
- Fixed a minor bug in tools.py. The -d (debug) flag for the update_database 
  script didn't halt on errors.

- Added a flush_threshold attribute to the DatabaseUpdater. This can be
  used to make the database flush after n records. By default the value
  is -1, and flushing only happens at the end of the update.
