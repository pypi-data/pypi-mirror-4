"""Things to help package binary tarballs.

HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

At the moment, we are assuming a great many things about these binary
tarballs.

* That they represent some sort of application to be run from an Ubuntu
  desktop

* Specifically, that although they might have many executables, only one is
  the "main executable" mentioned in the 'desktop' file

* They are written in C or C++ and that all dependencies can be determined
  by inspecting the included object files

* That the entire contents of the tarball can be copied into
  /opt/<package-name> and run from there

* That we have a metadata file, called 'devportal-metadata.json', in JSON.
  See ``MetadataBackend``.

The expectation is that this metadata file is generated from the developer
portal.
