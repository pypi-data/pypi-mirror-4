register-domain
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Registers a new domain.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* You cannot use an IAM policy to control domain access for this
  action. The --name of the domain being registered is available as
  the resource of this action.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
