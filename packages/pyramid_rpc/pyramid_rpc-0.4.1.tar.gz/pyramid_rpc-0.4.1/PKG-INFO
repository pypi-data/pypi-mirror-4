        --------
        
        - Python 3 compatibility.

        Backwards Incompatibilities
        ---------------------------

          + The default exception views are now registered with
            :data:`pyramid.security.NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` to ensure they are
            always invoked.
        
        - XML-RPC
        
          + Removed deprecated xmlrpc_view API.
