        =================
        
        A Python library and command-line utility for gettting data out of SharePoint.
        
        If you're more a Perl person, you might also want to try `SharePerltopus
        <https://github.com/cgutteridge/SharePerltopus>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Either install the latest development from ``git``::
        
           $ git clone git://github.com/ox-it/python-sharepoint.git
           $ cd python-sharepoint
           $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        â€¦ or, install the latest stable version using ``pip``::
        
           $ pip install sharepoint
        
        You will need `lxml <http://lxml.de/>`_, which you can install using your
        package manager or ``pip``. Run one of the following if it's not already
        installed::
        
           $ sudo apt-get install python-lxml  # Debian, Ubuntu
           $ sudo yum install python-lxml      # RedHat, Fedora
           $ sudo pip install lxml             # pip
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, you need to create a ``SharePointSite`` object. We'll assume you're
        using basic auth; if you're not, you'll need to create an appropriate `urllib2
        Opener <http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.build_opener>`_
        yourself.
        
        .. code::
        
           from sharepoint import SharePointSite, basic_auth_opener
        
           server_url = "http://sharepoint.example.org/"
           site_url = server_url + "sites/foo/bar"
        
           opener = basic_auth_opener(server_url, "username", "password")
        
           site = SharePointSite(site_url, opener)
        
        
        Lists
        ~~~~~
        
        First, get a list of SharePoint lists available::
        
           for sp_list in site.lists:
               print sp_list.id, sp_list.meta['Title']
        
        You can look up lists by ID, or by name::
        
           # By ID, without braces
           print site.lists['1EF5668C-0AB4-4020-98EF-26325E412C3C']
           # By ID, with braces
           print site.lists['1EF5668C-0AB4-4020-98EF-26325E412C3C']
           # By name
           print site.lists['ListName']
        
        Given a list, you can iterate over its rows::
        
           sp_list = site.lists['ListName']
           for row in sp_list.rows:
               print row.id, row.FieldName
        
        It's not yet possible to modify lists using this library.
        
        
        Command-line utility
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here's how to get a list of lists from a SharePoint site::
        
           $ sharepoint --site-url=http://sharepoint.example.org/sites/foo/bar \
                        --username=username --password=password
        
        And here's how to get an entire list as XML::
        
           $ sharepoint --site-url=http://sharepoint.example.org/sites/foo/bar \
                        --list-name=ListName \
                        --username=username --password=password
        
        You can also specify a file containing username and password in the format
        'username:password'::
        
           $ sharepoint --credentials=path/to/credentials [...]
        
        For help, use ``-h``::
        
           $ sharepoint -h
