Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The package plone.formwidget.datetime provides date and time widgets for plone
        to be used with z3c.form and Archetypes. The calendar widget is based on
        JQueryTools Dateinput, provided by plone.app.jquerytools.
        
        The package is a merge of collective.z3cform.datetimewidget
        and archetypes.datetimewidget (which itself was derived from
        collective.z3cform.datetimewidget).
        
        TODO

        * Include popup_calendar.gif as browser-resource in this package.
        * create DateDeltaWidget and DatetimeDeltaWidget
        * use timepicker

        =========
        
        1.0b1 (2012-10-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Include popup_calendar.gif and register a plone.formwidget.datetime style in
          the CSS registry.
          [thet]
        
        - Changes related to "Archetypes widget now reliably returns DateTime instances
          instead datetime."
        
            - support for only year widget [kiorky]
            - Fix support for older years inside AT widgets [kiorky]
            - Add lot of tests for year ranges & old years [kiorky]
            - Fix the Year and Month/Years widgets [kiorky]
             
        - Archetypes widget now reliably returns DateTime instances instead datetime.
          [thet]
        
        - AM/PM 12-hour time fixes: 12 a.m. == u'00' hour internally, displayed
          consistently; normalization of times gracefully handles missing hour
          values; deal gracefully with 12 p.m. and 12 a.m. hours.
