create-image
************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates an Amazon EBS-backed AMI from a "running" or "stopped"
instance. AMIs that use an Amazon EBS root device boot faster than
AMIs that use instance stores. They can be up to 1 TiB in size, use
storage that persists on instance failure, and can be stopped and
started.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "device_name": "string",
          "virtual_name": "string",
          "no_device": "string",
          "ebs": {
            {
              "delete_on_termination": true|false,
              "snapshot_id": "string",
              "volume_size": integer,
              "volume_type": "standard"|"io1",
              "iops": integer
            }
        }
        ...
      ]

"--no-reboot"  (boolean)
   By default this property is set to "false" , which means Amazon EC2
   attempts to cleanly shut down the instance before image creation
   and reboots the instance afterwards. When set to true, Amazon EC2
   will not shut down the instance before creating the image. When
   this option is used, file system integrity on the created image
   cannot be guaranteed.

"--description"  (string)
   The description for the new AMI being created.
