Description: Incuna Storages
        ===============
        
        A collection of django storage backends primarily used to set the location of files in the remote backend.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Using your favourite package manager: ::
        
            pip install incuna_storages
        
        Add to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``: ::
        
            ...
            'incuna_storages',
            ...
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        Set your storage backend to one of the included classes: ::
        
            DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'incuna_storages.backends.S3MediaStorage'
            STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'incuna_storages.backends.S3StaticStorage'
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        The included classes are built on top of existing packages. No assumptions have been made on which classes you'll be using so nothing has been added to ``required_packages``.
        
        Since you'll probably need other bits from the packages anyway it's been left up to you, the intrepid developer, to deal with the dependencies yourself.
