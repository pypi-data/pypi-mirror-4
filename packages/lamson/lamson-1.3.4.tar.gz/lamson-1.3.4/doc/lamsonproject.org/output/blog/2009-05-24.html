                <h1>Features For The 0.9 Release (Soon)</h1>
                
<p>I've been hard at work cooking up the very nice new routing system, and
I must say it is rather tasty.  I've gone and created a whole new
routing and state management design that uses decorators right in your
handler modules to indicate how each state will expect mail addresses.
</p>

<p>
For the 0.9 release happening tomorrow I've got a new Router setup,
spam filtering baked in nice and clean, improved test coverage, and 
indirect state storage for those who don't like SQLAlchemy.
</p>

<h2>New Routing Decorators</h2>
<p>The new routing design is very nice if I do say so myself.  It should
reduce the amount of Python regex wizardry you need to learn, help set
reasonable defaults, and put your handlers and routing in one spot so 
they are easier to maintain.  In addition the new design eliminated many
files and flaws from the previous design.
</p>

<p>Here's a quick sample from the unit tests:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
from lamson.routing import Router, route, route_like

Router.defaults(host="test.com", 
                action="[a-zA-Z0-9]+",
                list_name="[a-zA-Z.0-9]+")


@route("(list_name)-(action)@(host)")
def START(message, list_name=None, action=None, host=None):
    print "START", message, list_name, action, host
    if action == 'explode':
        print "EXPLODE!"
        raise RuntimeError("Exploded on purpose.")
    return UNKNOWN
    

@route("(list_name)-(action)@(host)")
def UNKNOWN(message, list_name=None, action=None, host=None):
    print "UNKNOWN", message, list_name, action, host
    return NEXT


@route_like(UNKNOWN)
def NEXT(message, list_name=None, action=None, host=None):
    print "NEXT", message, list_name, action, host
    return CONFIRM

@route_like(UNKNOWN)
def CONFIRM(message, list_name=None, action=None, host=None):
    print "CONFIRM", message, list_name, action, host
    return END

@route("(anything)@(host)", anything=".*")
def END(message, anything=None, host=None):
    print "END", anything, host
    return START
</pre>

<p>
The formatting on the @route decorator will hopefully simplify the use
of regular expressions.  Rather the above route for
"(list_name)-(action)@(host)" gets translated by Lamson into
'^(?P<list_name>[a-zA-Z.0-9]+)-(?P<action>[a-zA-Z0-9]+)@(?P<host>test.com)$'
which is a hair pulling monstrosity.  It also is using defaults so that you
only have to indicate basic formatting of the email and leave the regexes to
the main configuration file.
</p>

<p>
This new setup also has some interesting implications in how you can use it.
For example, you can register multiple address forms for each state (UNKNOWN, END, etc.)
so that it can handle similar activity.
</p>

<h2>Spam Filtering Per State</h2>

<p>
Now that the routing is nice and generic, I could implement a decorator for
using SpamBayes to filter spam to your state functions.  If you don't
want a particular state to receive spam then you just use the @spam_filter
decorator:
<p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
from lamson.routing import route, route_like
from lamson.spam import spam_filter

ham_db = "tests/sddb"

@route("(anything)@(host)", anything=".+", host=".+")
@spam_filter(ham_db, "tests/.hammierc", "run/queue")
def START(message, **kw):
    print "Ham message received. Going to END."
    return END

@route_like(START)
def END(message, *kw):
    print "Done."
</pre>

<p>
This simply attaches the @spam_filter decorator to START and then when START
runs it transitions to END.  It's still a little rough since you're having to
configure the @spam_filter right there, rather than in a config/settings.py file,
but it works.  Later versions will be much cleaner.
</p>

<h2>Indirect State Storage</h2>
<p>
I've also abstracted away the state storage, which will open the door to
backends in any kind of storage you want, not just SQLAlchemy.  The only thing you'll 
need to implement to use a different storage is a simple get/set/clear set of functionality
and then attach it to the Router class to make it use the new storage.
</p>

<p>
Currently the code is using a simple MemoryStorage class to speed up the unit test runs,
and then I'll implement the SQLAlchemy store and probably a Tokyo Tyrant store too.
</p>


<h2>Higher Test Coverage</h2>
<p>
I also worked on getting the unit test coverage up as high as I could.  Since Lamson is a
server with nasty OS level things like sockets and daemons, it is difficult to fully test
in just simple unit tests.  It's at about 85% right now with only the daemon and server
commands not being tested.
</p>

<p>
Finally, this new design gets rid of the old class based handlers, the Conversation style
of Finite State Machine handlers, and quite a bit of code that was design cruft from
my previous iterations.  It should be much cleaner and meaner, and will have a nicer
experience for developers.
</p>

<h2>Hold On Though</h2>

<p>The code in the bzr branch is still in a state of flux, so feel free to grab it and look, but
you probably don't want to actually do anything with it.  I should have all the samples
converted to the new style and then I'll do a 0.9 release.  It should happen tomorrow (May 25th).</p>

<p>I'll have another blog post and some documentation for the new stuff tomorrow and all next week.</p>
