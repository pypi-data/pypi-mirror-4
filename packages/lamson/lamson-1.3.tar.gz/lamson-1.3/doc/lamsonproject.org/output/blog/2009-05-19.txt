Title: New Site Look, Same Great Content

This is just a quick update to say thanks to "Ken Keiter":http://kenkeiter.com/
for creating a new "lamsonproject.org":http://lamsonproject.org/ site layout and
design.  The new site should be easier to read, have more breathing room, and look
easier on the eyes.  It's even got a logo:

Which I like quite a lot.

Feel free to shoot your comments about the design to "me.":/contact.html

h2. Two Days Of Spam Filtering

So far the new Lamson based spam blocking and filtering is working pretty well.
The majority of spam is blocked, however the success rate of
"SpamBayes":http://spambayes.sourceforge.net/ needs to improve.  Right now I've
trained it with a large set of ham, and with a reasonable number of spam
messages as I encounter them.  I think it's received about a 20/1 (ham/spam)
ratio for training.

With that training it's sorted about 50 spam, no false positives, and missed
about 15 spam as "unsure", with about 4 as "ham".  The 4 that were classified
as ham were just one liners with a link in them.  The unsure spam probably
could have just been treated as spam, but I'm being conservative while I test
it out.

Hopefully the success rate improves over the next few days.  SpamBayes is 
great for being a Python library I can use easily, but if it's success rate
doesn't get much higher then I may look at other options.  Of course, there
are more important things I could be doing right now too.
