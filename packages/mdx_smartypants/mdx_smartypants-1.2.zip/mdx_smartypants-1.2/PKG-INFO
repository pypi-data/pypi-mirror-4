Description: Markdown is great, but if you want pretty "curled" quotes, real em- and en-dashes,
        and the other typographic prettification that our modern Unicode- and Web-savvy
        world affords, it needs to be married with ``smartypants`` (or an equivalent
        module) to turn ugly, programmer-ish punctuation into pretty typographic punctuation.
        This module does that.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ::
          
            import markdown
            
            text = """
            Markdown makes HTML from simple text files. But--it lacks typographic
            "prettification." That... That'd be sweet. Definitely 7---8 on a '10-point
            scale'. Now it has it.
            
            Huzzah!
            """
            
            print markdown.markdown(text, extensions=['smartypants'])
        
        This produces nice HTML output, including typographically "pretty" quotes and
        other punctuation. It also renders HTML entites in their named rather than
        numeric form, which is easier on the eyes and more readily comprehended::
        
            <p>Markdown makes HTML from simple text files. But&mdash;it lacks
            typographic &ldquo;prettification.&rdquo; That&hellip; That&rsquo;d be
            sweet. Definitely 7&ndash;8 on a &lsquo;10-point scale&rsquo;. Now it has
            it.</p>
            <p>Huzzah!</p>
            
        Note that you don't really need to do an ``import mdx_smartypants``.
        You're welcome to if you like, and it may help to advertise that the code
        depends on ``mdx_smartypants`` being available. But ``markdown`` will
        look for ``mdx_smartypants`` simply
        by virtue of the ``extensions=['smartypants']`` declaration.
        
        ``mdx_smartypants`` will not massage indented code blocks, so your
        program snippets are safe.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
         *  The ``smartypants`` module (as of version 1.6.0.3) wrongly
            munges punctuation within style sections found in the document
            body. ``mdx_smartypants`` monkey-patches a fix for this.
            
         *  As of verison 1.2, ``mdx_smartpants`` no longer uses the stock
            ``smartypants`` module from PyPI. It incorporates a copy of
            the module, called ``spants``, in order to tweak the code
            for Python 3 compatibility. This
            is a partial step towards a rewrite of ``smartypants`` itself
            to support Python 3 and be more in-line with modern Python idioms.
         
         * Now
           successfully packaged for, and tests against, against Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
           
         * Commenced automated multi-version testing with
           `pytest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_
           and `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_.
           
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install mdx_smartypants
        
        To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::
        
            python3.3 -m easy_install mdx_smartypants
            
        (You may need to prefix these with "sudo " to authorize installation.)
