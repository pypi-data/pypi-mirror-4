list-signing-certificates
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns information about the signing certificates associated with the
specified user. If there are none, the action returns an empty list.

Although each user is limited to a small number of signing
certificates, you can still paginate the results using the "--max-
items" and "--marker" parameters.

If the "--user-name" field is not specified, the user name is
determined implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID used to sign the
request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, this API can be used to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws iam list-signing-certificates
     [--user-name <value>]
     [--marker <value>]
     [--max-items <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--user-name"  (string)
   The name of the user.

"--marker"  (string)
   Use this only when paginating results, and only in a subsequent
   request after you've received a response where the results are
   truncated. Set it to the value of the "--marker" element in the
   response you just received.

"--max-items"  (integer)
   Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum
   number of certificate IDs you want in the response. If there are
   additional certificate IDs beyond the maximum you specify, the
   "IsTruncated" response element is "true" .
