Description: 
        django-gubbins is a collection of useful snippets for enhancing
        or replacing functionality within Django. For more documentation, see the github
        page at https://github.com/carlio/django-gubbins
        
        Automatic downcasting to model subclasses :
        This is for the case when you have a model hierarchy, with several models inheriting from
        a base class, and you want to query the base class but get instances of the subclasses
        out of the query set.
        
        `EnumField` : provides an easy way to have a model field which only accepts 
        some values, and at the same time makes it easy to reference those values in your code.
        
        `JSONField` : allows you to store JSON strings in a database. 
        
        `ReusableAppURLs` : a simple way to create the correct URL configuration for a reusable
        django app.
        
        `SlowFileUploadHandler` : can be used to really slow down handling of file uploads. 
        This is an implementation of the Django file upload handler which will sleep between 
        processing chunks in order to simulate a slow upload. This is intended for development 
        when creating features such as an AJAXy file upload progress bar, as uploading to a 
        local process is often too quick.
