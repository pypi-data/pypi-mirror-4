Exceptions:

 - Portions of HMAC.py and setup.py are derived from Python 2.2, and

 - The various GNU autotools (autoconf, automake, aclocal, etc.) are
   used during the build process. This includes macros from
   autoconf-archive, which are located in the m4/ directory. As is
   customary, some files from the GNU autotools are included in the
   source tree (in the root directory, and in the build-aux/
   directory). These files are merely part of the build process, and
   are not included in binary builds of the software.
