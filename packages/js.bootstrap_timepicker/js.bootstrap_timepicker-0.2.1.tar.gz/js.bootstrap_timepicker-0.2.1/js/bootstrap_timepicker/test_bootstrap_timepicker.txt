How to use?
-----------


You can import ``bootstrap_timepicker`` from ``js.bootstrap_timepicker`` and
``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.bootstrap_timepicker import bootstrap_timepicker
  >>> bootstrap_timepicker.need()

The above includes both CSS and JS in your page.  If only need the JS *or* the
CSS you can also include them separately::

  >>> from js.bootstrap_timepicker import bootstrap_timepicker_js
  >>> bootstrap_timepicker_js.need()

or

  >>> from js.bootstrap_timepicker import bootstrap_timepicker_css
  >>> bootstrap_timepicker_css.need()
