DESCRIPTION
===========

The AWS Security Token Service is a web service that enables you to
request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and
Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate
(federated users). This guide provides descriptions of the AWS
Security Token Service API.

For more detailed information about using this service, go to Using
Temporary Security Credentials .

For information about setting up signatures and authorization through
the API, go to Signing AWS API Requests in the *AWS General Reference*
. For general information about the Query API, go to Making Query
Requests in *Using IAM* . For information about using security tokens

If you're new to AWS and need additional technical information about a
specific AWS product, you can find the product's technical
documentation at http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ .

We will refer to Amazon Identity and Access Management using the
