occmodel documentation
======================

**Overview**

occmodel is a small self-contained library which gives a
high level access to the OpenCASCADE modelling kernel.

For most users a direct use of the OpenCASCADE modelling
kernel can be quite a hurdle as it is a huge and complex
library.

The geometry can be visualized with the included viewer.
This viewer is utilizing modern OpenGL methods like GLSL
shaders and vertex buffers to ensure visual quality and
maximum speed. To use the viewer OpenGL version 2.1 is
needed.
 
Most of the code have been adapted from the freecad project (GPL 2).

The license is GPL v2.
