Description: Django Statsd Patches
        =====================
        
        These patches are designed to be used with django-statsd-mozilla_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From pypi::
        
                pip install django-statsd-patches
        
        This should install the requirement of django-statsd-mozilla_, but if not,
        you can install that with::
        
                pip install django-statsd-mozilla
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The monkeypatches need to be installed to work. To get them installed,
        add the following to your `settings.py`::
        
            STATSD_PATCHES = [
                'django_statsd_patches.patches.template',
                'django_statsd_patches.patches.redis_timing',
            ]
        
        By default both the `template` and `redis_timing` patches sample every
        call. To add sampling to the calls, define one or both of the following
        settings in your `settings.py`::
        
        
            STATSD_REDIS_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.5
            STATSD_TEMPLATE_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.25
        
        Then you'll get sampling of the calls.
