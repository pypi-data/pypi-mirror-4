Description: ==================
        SignedEmailMessage
        ==================
        
        SignedEmailMessage is a django package modifying the original, built-in EmailMessage 
        by adding a possibility to add signing certificats.
        
        INITIAL ACTIONS
        ===============

        	'SEM',
        	...
        	)
        
        2. Add default charset and your authentication certificate to your settings.
        DEFAULT_CHARSET = 'utf-8'
