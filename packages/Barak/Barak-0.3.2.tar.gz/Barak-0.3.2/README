This package contains functions useful for general scientific
programming, with a focus on astronomical research. The documentation
details everything that is available, but some example tasks that can
be handled are:

  * Calculate absorption profiles for various ions observed in
    astrophysical environments.
  * Fit a smooth continuum to a spectrum with many emission or
    absorption features.
  * Find the expected broad-band magnitudes given a spectral energy
    distribution.

More details are given in the documentation here:

To install, either download the tarball from the pypi website and then
do::

  python setup.py install

You may need to put a 'sudo' in front of this. 

A better way to install (which allows for easy uninstallation) is by
using pip::

  pip install barak

but you need to have pip
(http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html) installed.
 
To run the tests you need py.test
(http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html) installed.  Then run::

   py.test barak 

from this directory.
