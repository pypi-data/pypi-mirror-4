Description: To install::
        
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python setup.py develop
        
        Add to your trac.conf::
        
          [components]
          multireposearch.* = enabled
        
        Upgrade your trac environment::
        
          trac-admin path/to/env upgrade
        
        Prepare all available repositories with an initial indexing::
        
          trac-admin path/to/env multireposearch reindex_all
        
        You will now be able to perform text searches of repository contents through the trac search UI.
        
        As long as you have your trac post-commit or post-receive hooks properly configured, 
        source will remain up-to-date.
        
        Otherwise, to manually reindex a single repository, you ca run::
        
          trac-admin path/to/env multireposearch reindex repo-name
        
        Where repo-name is the name assigned to your repository in Trac.
