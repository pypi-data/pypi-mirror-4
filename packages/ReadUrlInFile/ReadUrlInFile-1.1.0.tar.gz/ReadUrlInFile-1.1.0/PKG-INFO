Version: 1.1.0
Summary: Sometimes you may want to read the URLs in a file(line by line), and use it directly in a method such like http.client.HTTPConnection(url), to avoid a mistake, you need to delete the last char "\n" in each URL. So this is a simple example, the programe ReadUrlInFile.py reads the URLs in a file named "list", and sends HTTP requesets to these URLs using the module http.client.
