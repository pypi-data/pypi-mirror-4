        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides a responsive replacement for the
        ``plone.global_sections`` viewlet. But note that just installing this
        theme in itself does not replace anything. You will have to adjust
        your theme to make use of this package.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1a3 (2012-11-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Small fix where the small menu is expanded when the window is
          resized from big to small.

        0.1a2 (2012-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Add a configuration option to always use the small menu when there
          are more than X menu items. (So we can prevent overflowing the menu
          even on 'desktop' screens.)
          [markvl]
        
        - Make the small version of the menu work: start with children
          collapsed (hidden) and expand (visible) when needed. First click
          expands, second click collapses.
          [markvl]
        
        - Use a class to mark that a menu item has children. (And remove the
          hard coded greater than sign.)
          [markvl]
        
        - Remove duplication from the menu templates by moving the complete
          <ul> structure to the menu_recurse template.
