MILK: MACHINE LEARNING TOOLKIT
==============================
Machine Learning in Python
--------------------------

Milk is a machine learning toolkit in Python.

Its focus is on supervised classification with several classifiers available:
SVMs (based on libsvm), k-NN, random forests, decision trees. It also performs
feature selection. These classifiers can be combined in many ways to form
different classification systems.

For unsupervised learning, milk supports k-means clustering and affinity
propagation.

Milk is flexible about its inputs. It optimised for numpy arrays, but can often
handle anything (for example, for SVMs, you can use any dataype and any kernel
and it does the right thing).

There is a strong emphasis on speed and low memory usage. Therefore, most of
the performance sensitive code is in C++. This is behind Python-based
interfaces for convenience.

To learn more, check the docs at `http://packages.python.org/milk/
<http://packages.python.org/milk/>`_ or the code demos included with the source
at ``milk/demos/``.

Examples
--------

Here is how to test how well you can classify some ``features,labels`` data,
measured by cross-validation::

    import numpy as np
    import milk
    features = np.random.rand(100,10) # 2d array of features: 100 examples of 10 features each
    labels = np.zeros(100)
    features[50:] += .5
    labels[50:] = 1
    confusion_matrix, names = milk.nfoldcrossvalidation(features, labels)
    print 'Accuracy:', confusion_matrix.trace()/float(confusion_matrix.sum())

If want to use a classifier, you instanciate a *learner object* and call its
``train()`` method::

    import numpy as np
    import milk
    features = np.random.rand(100,10)
    labels = np.zeros(100)
    features[50:] += .5
    labels[50:] = 1
    learner = milk.defaultclassifier()
    model = learner.train(features, labels)

    # Now you can use the model on new examples:
    example = np.random.rand(10)
    print model.apply(example)
    example2 = np.random.rand(10)
    example2 += .5
    print model.apply(example2)
    
There are several classification methods in the package, but they all use the
same interface: ``train()`` returns a *model* object, which has an ``apply()``
method to execute on new instances.
