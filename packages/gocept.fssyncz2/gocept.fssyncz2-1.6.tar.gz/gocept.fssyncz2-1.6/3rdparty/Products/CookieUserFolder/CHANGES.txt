CookieUserFolder version and change information

    1.4

      Bugs fixed:

        * Improved the "handing off" of authentication in situations with 
          user folders higher up in the tree. It is still iffy but will
          work in most cases now.


    1.3

      Bugs fixed:

        * Basic HTTP auth is now used as the last resort. This prevents
          the login screen popping up when instantiating the 
          CookieUserFolder object and it allows FTP and WebDAV use, which
          expect simple auth to work.

        * Fixed inheritance issues with ObjectManager and UserFolder which
          allowed me to get rid of my overridden objectids and objectItems
          methods.

        * A mangled "select" tag in the Custom Forms management page broke
          the dropdown list of objects to add for Mozilla users.

        * Changed the migration script to use the factory and not just the
          constructor


    1.2

      Features added:

        * Much-expanded README.txt and INSTALL.txt

        * Added migration script that can be used to migrate user 
          accounts from an existing standard user folder. See README.txt
          for instructions.


    1.1

      Bugs fixed:

        * If the setup had a non-cookie user folder above the login screen
          would never go away, even if the user was valid in the user folder
          above.

          The validation mechanism now explicitly retrieves and asks the next
          userfolder above to authenticate a user if there is one.
