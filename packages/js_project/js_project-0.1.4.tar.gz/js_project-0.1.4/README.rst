JS Project
==========

This package provides a pcreate scaffold for creating a
`Fanstatic <http://fanstatic.org>`_ js.\* library project.

JS Project uses the Pyramid Scaffold pcreate command to create a
barebones python project which provices a Fanstatic js.\* resource.

Usage
-----

    $ pcreate -s js_project <project_name>

The new project will contain dummy css and js files linked as Fanstatic
resources. These resources are ready to be 'need()'ed (though of course
they are empty.
