Just a basic python wrapper for most of the Mysql Admin commands. Got tired of having to exit python and going to mysql shell for the same. Been using it in production on mysql Ver 14.12 Distrib 5.0.77, for some time(occasionally tried with percona too).

though no proper test cases/testing has been done....


TO INSTALL : 
Just clone the repo, cd to the directory and run sudo python setup.py install.

Or just use sudo easy_install dbadmin

Usage:

from DbAdmin import DbAdministrator
DA = DbAdministrator()
