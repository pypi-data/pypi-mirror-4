README: nlpkit
============================================================

nlpkit is a collection of command line utillities and Python libraries
intended to helpful in performing natural language processing tasks.

What is an NLP related task, then? In my experience it mostly has to do
with feeding picky command line tools with awkwardly formatted input
and then afterwards try to decipher their output. That's at least what
nlpkit will help you do.

Although some of the modules in nlpkit fit nicely together, it's not
intended as a framework. Note that dependencies on other Python 
modules are not handled in the package and must be installed separately.
