The film is a [[satire]] of big-budget [[action film]]s and their associated [[clich√©]]s and [[stereotype]]s, with particular humorous emphasis on the global implications of [[Politics of the United States|US politics]]. The title of the film itself is derived from domestic and international political criticisms that the U.S. frequently and unilaterally tries to "[[American foreign policy|police the world]]". The film features a cast composed of [[marionette]]s. ''Team America'' focuses on a fictional team of political [[paramilitary]] policemen known as "Team America: World Police", who attempt to save the world from a violent terrorist plot led by [[Kim Jong-il]].
