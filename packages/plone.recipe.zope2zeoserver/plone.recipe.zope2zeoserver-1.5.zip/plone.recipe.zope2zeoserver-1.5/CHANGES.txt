Change History
==============

1.5 (2013-01-29)
----------------

- LP #503686: Added support for setting ZEO log level.
  [baijum]

- Added note on 'eggs' option.
  [ajung]

- Added option to customize repozo and zeopack names
  [do3cc]

1.4 (2009-10-15)
----------------

* Make sure that it's still possible to specify a storage to pack using the -S
  parameter for bin/zeopack.
  [davisagli]

* Documented the format of the authentication database file.
  [hannosch]

* Added support for more than one zeoinstance per buildout on win32 environments
  [erico_andrei]

* Added support for relative-paths in the script generation.
  [jvloothuis]

1.3 (2009-05-14)
----------------

* Added the new `pack-days`, `pack-user` and `pack-password` options to give
  more flexible options for the zeopack script and support packing databases
  which require authentication. Also reworked the zeopack internals to support
  packing blob storages. The default for packing is now to retain one day of
  database history.
  [hannosch]

1.2 (2009-02-25)
----------------

* Generate a bin/repozo script to perform backups using repozo.py (and
  set up the appropriate pythonpath for this to work).
  Copied from plone.recipe.zope2instance.
  [fschulze]

* Added support for the zeo.conf 'monitor-address' parameter.
  [mattss]

1.1 (2008-12-05)
----------------

* Pass PYTHONPATH generated by recipe into zopeservice.py, so that it
  is properly setup and passed to service controlled environment. This
  makes it possible to use third-party ZConfig extensions with ZEO,
  like iw.rotatezlogs.
  [sidnei]

1.0 (2008-11-04)
----------------

* Bump version number to 1.0 since this has been stable for a long time.
  [wichert]

* Add MANIFEST.in file so we can create a release from an export.
  [wichert]


0.17 (2008-11-04)
-----------------

- Make the log format configurable and change the default to include the
  current time.
  [wichert]


0.16 (2008-10-15)
-----------------

- Adjusted the Supervisord support to ignore the command sent to the script.
  This avoids a `positional arguments are not supported` error.
  [hannosch]

- The launch script now detects if it is being executed from Supervisord.
  This makes it more manageable for Supervisord since it no longer forks.
  [jvloothuis]


0.15 (2008-08-27)
-----------------

- Renamed zeoservice.py to zeoservice.py.in to avoid errors during egg
  creation, as it tries to compile the template file.
  [hannosch]


0.14 (2008-08-21)
-----------------

- Fix the test to not rely on a specific installation folder name.
  [dataflake]

- Added support for a unix socket path in `zeo-address` and expanded the
  test coverage for the `zeopack` script generation.
  [dataflake]

- Add support for ZEO authentication.
  [wichert]


0.13 (2008-03-27)
-----------------

- Fixed call to HandleCommandLine by computing the serviceClassString
  ourselves if our module name is not __main__ (ie, if it was imported
  from another module). This works around the fact that
  HandleCommandLine calls GetServiceClassString which in turn only
  calculates the full path if the original module is __main__.
  [sidnei]

- Fixed generation of runzeo.bat when using ZEO from egg, where ZConfig is not
  in ZODB3_HOME.
  [rochael]

- Only generate the Windows service scripts if there is a zope2-location, since
  it's currently the only place where the nt_svcutils can be found.
  [rochael]

- Fixed test breakages on Windows.
  [rochael]


0.12 (2008-03-02)
-----------------

- Fixed zeopack generation so it includes zope-location.
  [tarek]


0.11 (2008-02-19)
-----------------

- Made Python 2.3 compatible
  [fschulze]

- Added win32 specific scripts.
  [tarek]

- Added a `zeo-log-custom` option.
  [tarek]

- Added a test environement and a basic doctest to validate the recipe.
  [tarek]


0.10 (2008-01-09)
-----------------

- Calculate the package working set outside of the recipe constructor. Closes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/180084
  [rochael]


0.9 (2007-12-30)
----------------

- Added `invalidation-queue-size` and `storage-number` options.
  [hannosch]

- Merged rochael-blobsupport branch. Added support for ZODB 3.8 blob storage
  configuration. This adds the blob-storage option. This closes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179115 and
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/collective.buildout/+bug/179117.
  [rochael, hannosch]

- Renamed `zope-conf-additional` option to `zeo-conf-additional`.
  [rochael]


0.8
---

- Small documentation update. Added link to the bugtracker.
  [hannosch]

- Have PID file's location default to `${buildout:directory}/var/${name}.pid`.
  Keeping the PID file in $INSTANCE_HOME gives trouble when buildout rebuilds
  the part.
  [nouri, mbenali]


0.7
---

- Change default location of zeo socket to var.
  [smcmahon]

- Add option to set socket-name.
  [smcmahon]


0.6
---

- Move the documentation to a separate README.txt and read that from setup.py.
  [wichert]

- Add a wrapper around zeopack which inserts default options for our ZEO server.
  [wichert]


0.5
---

- Added an option to set the effective-user.
  [optilude]


0.3
---

- Updated setup.py.
  [optilude]


0.2
---

- Similarly, there are some hardcoded dependencies on $INSTANCE_HOME/etc/.
  [optilude]

- Documented options, cleaned up code, and added the ability to use a manual
  zeo.conf.
  [optilude]

- Make this work, at least on OS X and probably unix-like system. It wouldn't
  surprise me if this needs adjustment for Windows in the same way that we do
  in plone.recipe.zope2instance. :-(
  [optilude]


0.1
---

- Initial implementation.
  [regebro, hannosch]
