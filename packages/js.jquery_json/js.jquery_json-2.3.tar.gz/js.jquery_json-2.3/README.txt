js.jquery_json
**************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jquery-json`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jquery-json`: https://code.google.com/p/jquery-json/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_json``) are published to some URL.
