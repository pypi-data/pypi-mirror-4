        =======================
        
        Pywunder is a very simple wrapper around the wundergroudn weather API, at this stage it is mostly incomplete, providing only very simple access to the forecasts api.
        
        To use it do the following::
        
            import pywunder
            client = pywunder.Client("your api key")
            forecasts = client.forecats("UK/London") #Gives you a four day forecast
            forecasts[0].description
            >>> u'Clear in the morning, then partly cloudy. High of 16C. Breezy. Winds from the SW at 15 to 20 km/h.'
