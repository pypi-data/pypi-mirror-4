Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for
who can view and modify the logging parameters. To set the logging
status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws s3 put-bucket-logging
     --bucket-logging-status <value>
     --bucket <value>
     [--content-md5 <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--bucket-logging-status"  (structure)
   "logging_enabled"  (structure)
      "target_prefix"  (string)This element lets you specify a prefix
      for the keys that the log files will be stored under.

      "target_bucket"  (string)Specifies the bucket where you want
      Amazon S3 to store server access logs. You can have your logs
      delivered to any bucket that you own, including the same bucket
      that is being logged. You can also configure multiple buckets to
      deliver their logs to the same target bucket. In this case you
      should choose a different TargetPrefix for each source bucket so
      that the delivered log files can be distinguished by key.

      "target_grants"  (list)
         (structure)
            "grantee"  (structure)
               "email_address"  (string)Email address of the grantee.
