list-domains
************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the list of domains registered in the account. The results may
be split into multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make the
call again using the --next-page-token returned by the initial call.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the domain name to limit the action to
  only specified domains. The element must be set to
  "arn:aws:swf::AccountID:domain/*"" , where â€œAccountID" is the
  account ID, with no dashes.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf list-domains
     --registration-status <value>
     [--next-page-token <value>]
     [--maximum-page-size <value>]
     [--reverse-order ]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--registration-status"  (string)
   Specifies the registration status of the domains to list.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--next-page-token"  (string)
   If on a previous call to this method a "NextPageToken" was
   returned, the result has more than one page. To get the next page
   of results, repeat the call with the returned token and all other
   arguments unchanged.

"--maximum-page-size"  (integer)
   The maximum number of results returned in each page. The default is
   100, but the caller can override this value to a page size
   *smaller* than the default. You cannot specify a page size greater
   than 100. Note that the number of domains may be less than the
   maxiumum page size, in which case, the returned page will have
   fewer results than the --maximum-page-size specified.

"--reverse-order"  (boolean)
   When set to "true" , returns the results in reverse order. By
   default the results are returned in ascending alphabetical order of
   the "name" of the domains.
