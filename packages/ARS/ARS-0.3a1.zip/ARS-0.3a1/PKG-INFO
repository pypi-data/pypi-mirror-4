Description: ========================================
        Autonomous Robot Simulator (ARS)
        ========================================
        
        ARS is a physically-accurate open-source simulation suite for research and
        development of mobile manipulators and, in general, any multi-body system. It
        is modular, easy to learn and use, and can be a valuable tool in the process
        of robot design, in the development of control and reasoning algorithms, as
        well as in teaching and educational activities.
        
        It will encompass a wide range of tools spanning from kinematics and dynamics
        simulation to robot interfacing and control.
        
        The software is implemented in Python integrating the
        `Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) <https://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/>`_
        and the `Visualization Toolkit (VTK) <http://www.vtk.org/>`_.
        
        Requirements
        ====================
        * Python 2.7 (developed with 2.7.3)
          http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
        * ODE (Open Dynamics Engine) 0.12 (from rev 1864 could work but is untested) with Python bindings
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/opende/
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/arsproject/files/ODE/
        * VTK (Visualization Toolkit) 5.8 (developed with 5.8.0 and used to be 5.2.1) with Python bindings
          http://www.vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html
          https://sourceforge.net/projects/arsproject/files/VTK/
        
        Documentation
        ====================
        The documentation is hosted at
        `ReadTheDocs.org <http://ars-project.readthedocs.org>`_
        and it is generated dynamically after each commit to the repository.
