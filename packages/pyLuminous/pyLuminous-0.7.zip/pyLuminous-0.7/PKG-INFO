Description:         This library consists of two sublibraries pyFresnel and pyQW for performing
                physics simulations. pyFresnel contains codes for modelling the optical 
                properties of dielectric layers, starting from a simple interface and
                finishing with an optical transfer matrix code. Unlike other optical 
                transfer matrix codes, this code allows for layers with uniaxial dielectrics
                which have their the optical axes normal to the plane of the layers.
                
                pyQW is a code for a semi-analytical simulation of a finite semiconductor
                quantum well (conduction band). It also models the well's intersubband
                transitions (transitions between the conduction band levels).
                        
                This library depends upon numpy, scipy and matplotlib.
