        About collective.monkeypatcherpanel
        ===================================
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.monkeypatcherpanel is the Zope 2 companion of Martin Aspeli's
        `collective.monkeypatcher
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.monkeypatcher>`_ component.
        
        It just add a ZMI control panel that shows what monkey patches have been applied
        in case you cannot see the logs or grep through the ZCML of your Zope
        instance. Open the control panel of your Zope instance and then the "Monkey
        Patches" control panel.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        collective.monkeypatcherpanel has been developed and tested with Zope 2.10,
        Zope 2.11 and Zope 2.12. It may run on Zope 2.9 but this is untested and not
        supported unless you provide a patch that keeps the tests smiling.
        
        Of course, we require `collective.monkeypatcher`. If you installed
        `collective.monkeypatcherpanel` with easy_install or a zc.buildout, you're done.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        In your ``buildout.cfg`` file, add this:
        
        ::
        
          [instance]
          recipe = colective.recipe.zope2instance
          ...
          eggs =
              ...
              collective.monkeypatcherpanel
              ...
          zcml =
              ...
              collective.monkeypatcherpanel
              ...
        
        Re-run your buildout then browse as Manager to
        ``http://<zope-root>/@@add-monkeypatcherpanel`` to add the control panel in your
        Zope 2 instance.
        
        Uninstall
        =========
        
        Browse as Manager to ``http://<zope-root>/@@remove-monkeypatcherpanel`` then
        remove ``collective.monkeypatcherpanel`` from your buildout configuration or
        file system. Otherwise you'll keep a broken object in your Zope 2 control panel.
