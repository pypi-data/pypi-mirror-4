Description: ------------
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This package extends all Archetypes of a Plonesite with a boolean field, that will be set to true if a workingcopy was created for an item via plone.app.iterate.
        
        This way, it is possible to have this information availiable as a criterion in a collection (old-style collections, a.k.a. topics).
        
        It's friendly name is 'Has workingcopy'.
        
        The field is set to hidden, we don't want it in the UI of an item.
