.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
set\-termination\-protection locks a job flow so the Amazon EC2 instances in the
cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an API call, or in the event
of a job\-flow error. The cluster still terminates upon successful completion of
the job flow. Calling set\-termination\-protection on a job flow is analogous to
calling the Amazon EC2 DisableAPITermination API on all of the EC2 instances in
a cluster.
.sp
set\-termination\-protection is used to prevent accidental termination of a job
flow and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances will persist so
you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance storage.
.sp
To terminate a job flow that has been locked by setting
set\-termination\-protection to \fBtrue\fP , you must first unlock the job flow by a
subsequent call to set\-termination\-protection in which you set the value to
\fBfalse\fP .
.sp
For more information, go to \fI\%Protecting a Job Flow from Termination\fP in the \fIAmazon Elastic MapReduce Developer\(aqs Guide.\fP

.TP
.B \fB\-\-termination\-protected\fP  | \fB\-\-no\-termination\-protected\fP  (boolean)
A Boolean that indicates whether to protect the job flow and prevent the
Amazon EC2 instances in the cluster from shutting down due to API calls, user
intervention, or job\-flow error.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-job\-flow\-ids\fP  (list of string)
A list of strings that uniquely identify the job flows to protect. This
identifier is returned by  run\-job\-flow and can also be obtained from
describe\-job\-flows .
