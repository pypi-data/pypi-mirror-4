delete-environment-configuration
********************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes the draft configuration associated with the running
environment.

Updating a running environment with any configuration changes creates
a draft configuration set. You can get the draft configuration using
describe-configuration-settings while the update is in progress or if
the update fails. The "DeploymentStatus" for the draft configuration
indicates whether the deployment is in process or has failed. The
draft configuration remains in existence until it is deleted with this
action.
