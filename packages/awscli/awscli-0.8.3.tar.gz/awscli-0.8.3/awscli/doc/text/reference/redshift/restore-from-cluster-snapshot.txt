restore-from-cluster-snapshot
*****************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new cluster from a snapshot. Amazon Redshift creates the
resulting cluster with the same configuration as the original cluster
from which the snapshot was created, except that the new cluster is
created with the default cluster security and parameter group. After
Amazon Redshift creates the cluster you can use the  modify-cluster
API to associate a different security group and different parameter
group with the restored cluster.

If a snapshot is taken of a cluster in VPC, you can restore it only in
VPC. In this case, you must provide a cluster subnet group where you
want the cluster restored. If snapshot is taken of a cluster outside
VPC, then you can restore it only outside VPC.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws redshift restore-from-cluster-snapshot
     --cluster-identifier <value>
     --snapshot-identifier <value>
     [--availability-zone <value>]
     [--publicly-accessible ]
     [--allow-version-upgrade ]
     [--cluster-subnet-group-name <value>]
     [--port <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--cluster-identifier"  (string)
   The identifier of the cluster that will be created from restoring
   the snapshot.

"--snapshot-identifier"  (string)
   The name of the snapshot from which to create the new cluster. This
   parameter isn't case sensitive.

   Example: "my-snapshot-id"


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--availability-zone"  (string)
   The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone in which to restore the cluster.

   Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

   Example: "us-east-1a"

"--publicly-accessible"  (boolean)
   If "true" , the cluster can be accessed from a public network.

"--allow-version-upgrade"  (boolean)
   If "true" , upgrades can be applied during the maintenance window
   to the engine that is running on the cluster.

   Default: "true"

"--cluster-subnet-group-name"  (string)
   The name of the subnet group where you want to cluster restored.

   A snapshot of cluster in VPC can be restored only in VPC.
   Therefore, you must provide subnet group name where you want the
   cluster restored.

"--port"  (integer)
   The port number on which the cluster accepts connections.

   Default: The same port as the original cluster.

   Constraints: Must be between "1115" and "65535" .
