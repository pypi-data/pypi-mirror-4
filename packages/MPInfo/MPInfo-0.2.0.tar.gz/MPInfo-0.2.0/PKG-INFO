        MPInfo
        ======
        
        MPInfo is an attempt to remedy the deficiencies of the official UK Parliament API (http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/api). In general, if people want to know who their MP is, they also want to get in touch with them, but this API returns no contact details.
        
        MPInfo screen-scrapes the MP's biography page (returned through the above API) and retrieves a telephone number, fax number, postal address and email address for the MP, at both their constituency and Westminster, where possible. There is also some support for retrieving other information, such as Select Committee positions, but this is very much a work in progress.
