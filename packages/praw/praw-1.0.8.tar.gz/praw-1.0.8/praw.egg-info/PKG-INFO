Description: # Introduction
        
        PRAW, an acronym for "Python Reddit API Wrapper", is a python package that
        allows for simple access to reddit's API.  PRAW aims to be as easy to use as
        possible. Here's a quick peek, getting the first 5 submissions from the 'hot'
        section of the 'opensource' subreddit.
        
        ```python
        import praw
        r = praw.Reddit(user_agent='my_cool_application')
        submissions = r.get_subreddit('opensource').get_hot(limit=5)
        [str(x) for x in submissions]
        ```
        
        This will display something similar to the following:
        
        ```python
        ['10 :: Gun.io Debuts Group Funding for Open Source Projects\n Gun.io',
         '24 :: Support the Free Software Foundation',
         '67 :: The 10 Most Important Open Source Projects of 2011',
          '2 :: Open-source webOS is dead on arrival ',
         '85 :: Plan 9 - A distributed OS with a unified communication protocol and I/O driver model.  Wow.']
        ```
        
        # Installation
        You can install via `pip`
        
            pip install praw
        
        Or via `easy_install`
        
            easy_install praw
        
        Or via `setup.py`
        
            # First download or checkout the code then run
            python setup.py install
        
        PRAW works with Python 2.6 or later.
        
        Installation via `pip` or `easy_install` automatically installs PRAW's only
        dependency, the module [six](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/six/). If you install 
        via `setup.py` you'll need to install `six` manually.
        
        # Examples and Configuration
        
        For a number of simple code examples, details on PRAW's
        configuration files and links to projects which use this package see the
        [wiki](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/wiki).
        
        
        # FAQ
        > Why is everything so slow?
        
        Usually that has to do with how fast reddit is responding at the moment. Check
        the site, see if it's responding quicker when accessing it in your browser.
        Otherwise, we respect the "no more than one API call per two seconds" rule, so
        if you're trying to do a bunch of quick requests in succession you're going to
        be spaced out to one call per second. If you're having a specific issue besides
        something covered by one of those two things, please let us know (or file a
        ticket) and we'll check it out.
