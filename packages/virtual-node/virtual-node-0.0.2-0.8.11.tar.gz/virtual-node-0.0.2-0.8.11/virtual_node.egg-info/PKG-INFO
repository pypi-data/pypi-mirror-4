        This package is a wrapper around the `node.js`_ sources and provides a
        convenient way to install it directly into your ``virtualenv`` instead
        of globally. I created this package to play around with a simple 
        installation for Django projects that use `django-compressor`_'s
        precompiler to generate CSS from `less`_ files.
        
        The install routine used in ``setup.py`` is adapted from the
        `nodeenv`_ package provided by Eugene Kalinin. The difference is that I want
        to install node.js into an existing ``virtualenv`` instead of creating
        a specific environment for node.
        
        I am using this in combination with `virtual-less`_ which installs the
        ``lessc`` commandline tool into a virtual environment.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. warning:: This will download the node.js sources and compile it into your
            virtualenv. Make sure that you have all required build dependencies for
            node.js installed before installing virtual-node. The installation will
            take quite a long time to run for the first time around, so have a coffee
            or a beer handy.
        
        Installing the ``node`` into your virtual environment is as easy as::
        
            $ pip install virtual-node
        
        That should be it. You should now be able to run ``node`` from within
        your virtual environment even if you have it globally installed. You
        can make sure that this is the case::
        
            $ which node
            /home/elbaschid/.virtualenvs/lessc-test/bin/node
        
        .. note:: virtual-node is explicitly meant to be installed into a virtualenv
            and not into your global environment. This has not been tested and will
            most likely not work or cause problems. Only try it if you know what you
            are doing.
