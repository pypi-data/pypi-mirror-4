        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the ``kotti_tagcloud`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
        Deploy config.  If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option,
        add one.  The line in your ``[app:main]`` (or ``[app:kotti]``, depending on how
        you setup Fanstatic) section could then look like this::
        
            kotti.configurators =
                kotti_settings.kotti_configure
                kotti_tagcloud.kotti_configure
        
        Please note that ``kotti_tagcloud`` depends on kotti_settings, so you have to
        list it in your ``kotti.configurators`` too.
        
        ``kotti_tagcloud`` extends your Kotti site with a widget where all tags that are
        assigned to any content and present it in a tagcloud. The particular tags are
        linked with the tag search of Kotti itself. The actual tag widget is build with
        `TagCanvas`_ and use `explorercanvas`_ to provide the HTML5 canvas tag also for
        the beloved Internet Explorer <= 0.8.
        
        In the settings of ``kotti_tagcloud`` you can choose the slot and the context where
        the widget will be shown. Just go to Site Setup -> Settings -> Tagcloud Settings and
        adjust it to your needs.
