        =======
        
        Rattail is a retail software framework based on `edbob <http://edbob.org/>`_,
        and released under the GNU Affero General Public License.
        
        This is the core ``rattail`` package.

        0.3a22
        ------
        
        - [feature] Added ``LabelProfile.visible`` field.
        
        - [feature] Added generic ``CommandNetworkPrinter`` label printer class.  This
          class sends textual commands directly to a networked printer.
        
        0.3a21
        ------
        
        - [feature] Refactored database synchronization logic into a proper class,
          which can be overridden based on configuration.
        
        0.3a20
        ------
        
        - [feature] Tweaked the SIL writer so that it doesn't quote row values when
          they're of data type ``float``.
        
        - [bug] Fixed database sync to properly handle ``Vendor`` deletions.  Now any
          associated ``ProductCost`` records are also deleted, so no more foreign key
          violations.
        
        0.3a19
        ------
        
        - [bug] Fixed "price toggle" bug in database sync.  It was noticed that
          whenever a product's regular price did not change, yet the product instance
          itself *did* have a change, the regular price association was being removed
          in one sync, then reestablished in the next sync (then removed, etc.).  The
          sync operation now ensures the relationship is removed only when it really
          should be, and that it remains intact when that is appropriate.
        
        0.3a18
        ------
        
        - [bug] Added special delete logic to the database sync.  Currently, only the
          Department and Subdepartment classes are affected.  When deletions of these
          classes are to be synced between databases, some effort is made to ensure
          that associations with any dependent objects (e.g. Product) are removed
          before the primary instance (e.g. Department) is deleted.
        
        0.3a17
        ------
        
        - [bug] Added 'delete, delete-orphan' to cascade on ``Product.costs``
          relationship.  This was causing an error when syncing databases.
        
        0.3a16
        ------
        
        - [bug] Added 'delete, delete-orphan' to cascade on ``Product.prices``
          relationship.  This was causing an error when syncing databases.
        
        0.3a15
        ------
        
        - [bug] Fixed database sync logic to ensure ``Product`` changes are processed
          before ``ProductPrice`` changes.  Since the underlying tables are mutually
          dependent, the ``dependency_sort()`` call can't *quite* take care of it.  Now
          a lexical sort is applied to the class names before the dependency sort
          happens.  This is somewhat of a hack, merely taking advantage of the fact
          that "Product" comes before "ProductPrice" when lexically sorted.  If other
          mutually-dependent tables come about in the future, this approach may need to
          be revised if their class names don't jive.
        
        0.3a14
        ------
        
        - [bug] Fixed database synchonization logic to properly handle merging
          ``Product`` instances between database sessions.  Since ``Product`` is so
          interdependent on ``ProductPrice``, a pretty custom merge hack is required.
        
        0.3a13
        ------
        
        - [bugfix] Fixed ``rattail.db.record_changes()`` so that it also ignores
          ``UserRole`` instance changes if configuration dictates that ``Role`` changes
          are to be ignored.
        
        0.3a12
        ------
        
        - [bugfix] Fixed foreign key uuid handling in ``rattail.db.record_changes()``.
          Some tables are meant to be used solely as providers of "association proxy"
          fields, the ``uuid`` column is not only a primary key, but also a *foreign
          key* to the "primary" entity table.  In such cases, the uuid value was not
          present at session flush time, so a new one was being generated.
          Unfortunately this meant that the ``Change`` record would point to a
          nonexistent entity record, so the sync would not work.  Now uuid fields are
          inspected to determine if a foreign key is present, in which case the
          relationship is traversed and the true uuid value is used.
        
        - [feature] Added "extra classes" configuration for the ``load-host-data``
          command.  This is necessary when initially populating a "store" (er,
          "non-host") database instance if custom schema extensions are in use (and
          need to be synchronized with the host).
