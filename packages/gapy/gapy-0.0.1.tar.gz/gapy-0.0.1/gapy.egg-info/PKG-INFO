Description: # Gapy
        
        Gapy is a thin service account client for Google Analytics. 
        
        # Get set up
        
        First you need to create a service account in your [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console).
        Then just create a gapy client and start querying.
        
        {{{python
        import gapy
        
        client = gapy.service_account()
        client.query.get("12345", datetime(2012, 1, 1), datetime(2012, 2, 2), "visits", "date")
        }}}
