Changelog
=========

1.2.0 (2012-10-18)
------------------

- Fixed stories to always have a minimum size of 1 point.

1.1.0 (2012-10-18)
------------------

- Fixed to not crash on story parsing error, but print url of the failing
  story instead.

1.0.0 (2012-05-26)
------------------

- Added support for config files and possibility to define epics using them.
- Changed scenarios parsed from tasks to be parsed only after parsing
  description (to allow definition of story-level steps in description).

1.0a5 (2011-08-28)
------------------

- Added support for tasks: If a story has tasks, their descriptions will be
  parsed for scenarios (and those will be appended) before parsing story's main
  description.

1.0a4 (2011-08-26)
------------------

- Fixed to replace every " with ' before parsing scenario descriptions. If "s
  were allowed to let through, those should be escaped in test decorators,
  which would look ugly.

1.0a3 (2011-08-02)
------------------

- Fixed package info to match with other corejet packages.

1.0a2 (2011-08-02)
------------------

- Connected Pivotal estimates to CoreJet points.
- Added filter for stories with no scenarios.

1.0a1 (2011-08-01)
------------------

- First release.
