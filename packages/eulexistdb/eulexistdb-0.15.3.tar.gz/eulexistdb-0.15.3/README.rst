EULexistdb
==========

EULexistdb is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ module that
provides utilities and classes for interacting with the `eXist-db XML
Database <http://exist.sourceforge.net/>`_ (version 1.4) in a
pythonic, object-oriented way, with optional `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ integration.

**eulexistdb.db** provides access to an eXist-db instance through
eXist's `XML-RPC API
<http://exist.sourceforge.net/devguide_xmlrpc.html>`_.  

**eulexistdb.query** provides a **QuerySet** class modeled after
`Django QuerySet
<http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/models/querysets/>`_ in
functionality.  This module provides **model** and **manager** classes
that can be used to connect an `eulxml
<https://github.com/emory-libraries/eulxml>`_ **XmlObject** with the
**QuerySet** class, in order to generate XQueries and return the
results as XmlObject instances.  However, configuring the XmlObject
XPaths to make efficent XQueries against eXist and take advantage of
the full-text index does require expertise and familiarity with eXist.

When used with `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,
**eulexistdb** can pull the database connection configuration from
Django settings, provides a custom management command for working with
the collection index configuration index in the configured eXist
database, and also provides a custom template tag that can be used to
highlight full-text search matches.


Dependencies
------------

**eulexistdb** currently depends on 
`eulxml <https://github.com/emory-libraries/eulxml>`_.

**eulexistdb** can be used without 
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, but additional
functionality is available when used with Django.
