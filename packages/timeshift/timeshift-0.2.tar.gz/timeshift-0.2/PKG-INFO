Description: Timeshift
        =========
        
        ``timeshift`` is a python program for recording Internet radio streams and saving
        them for later listening (`<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeshifting>`_).

        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        ::
        
          $ easy_install timeshift
          $ cat << EOF > timeshift.conf 
          [DEFAULT]
          basedir = /tmp
          baseurl = http://localhost/tmp
        
          [NPR]
          title = "National Public Radio"
          url = http://npr.ic.llnwd.net/stream/npr_live24
          duration = 60
          feedfile = npr.atom
          EOF
          $ python timeshift.py NPR
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest installation method is to use Python's ``easy_install`` or
        ``pip`` to install the package from `PyPI
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/timeshift>`_::
        
          pip install timeshift
        
        To install from source, you can clone the project from `BitBucket
        <http://bitbucket.org/nmb/timeshift>`_::
        
          hg clone https://bitbucket.org/nmb/timeshift
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        ``timeshift`` uses a configuration file by default named ``timeshift.conf`` in
        the current directory.  To specify a different file use the ``--config=FILE``
        option.  The configuration file specifies a global location and URL::
        
            [DEFAULT]
            basedir = /tmp
            baseurl = http://localhost/tmp
        
        where ``basedir`` is the local directory where files will be saved and
        ``baseurl`` is the URL where those files can be accessed.
        
        Each source is specified by a separate stanza in the configuration file::
        
          [NPR]
          title = "National Public Radio"
          url = http://npr.ic.llnwd.net/stream/npr_live24
          duration = 60
          feedfile = npr.atom
        
        where ``title`` is a long name for source, ``url`` is the location to record
        from, ``duration`` is the time in *seconds* to record, and ``feedfile`` is the
        name of the file in ``basedir`` to write an `Atom
        <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287>`_ feed to (for use with podcasting
        software).
        
        The ``url`` for the source is the location from which to download the stream.
        This can often be found by *downloading* the MP3 playlist of the stream and
        looking for the ``File1`` value inside.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Simply run the ``timeshift.py`` script with the name of the section that you
        wish to record: ``python timeshift.py NPR``.  That will record for the
        specified number of seconds to a suitably named file in ``basedir`` and will
        add that file to the specified Atom feed in the same directory.
        
        To record at regular intervals, use the ``cron`` facility under Unix.  For
        example, to record at 17:00 every saturday you could use the crontab line::
        
          # m h  dom mon dow   command
          0 17 * * SAT python /path/to/timeshift.py --config=/path/to/timeshift.conf NPR
