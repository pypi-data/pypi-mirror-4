Description: 
        TrueSkill
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        An implementation of the TrueSkill algorithm for Python. TrueSkill is a rating
        system among game players and it is used on Xbox Live to rank and match
        players.
        
        >>> from trueskill import Rating, transform_ratings, match_quality
        >>> p1, p2, p3, p4 = Rating(), Rating(), Rating(), Rating()
        >>> team1, team2, team3 = (p1,), (p2, p3), (p4,)
        >>> transform_ratings([team1, team2, team3]) #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
        [(Rating(mu=35.877, sigma=6.791),),
         (Rating(mu=17.867, sigma=7.059), Rating(mu=17.867, sigma=7.059)),
         (Rating(mu=21.255, sigma=7.155),)]
        >>> print '%.1f%%' % (match_quality([team1, team2, team3]) * 100)
        4.7%
