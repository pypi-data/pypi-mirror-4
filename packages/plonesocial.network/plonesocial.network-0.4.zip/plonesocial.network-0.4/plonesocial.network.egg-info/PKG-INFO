Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Plonesocial.network is part of the `plonesocial suite`_.
        
        This package provides a building block for Plone integrators who want to create a custom social business solution in Plone.
        
        If you're an end-user looking for a pre-integrated solution, you should install `plonesocial.suite`_ instead.

        ===================
        
        Plonesocial.network provides user profiles with follow/unfollow functionality.
        It intercepts and overrides the default Plone ``author.cpt`` profile page.
        If `plonesocial.activitystream`_ is installed, it will show status updates on the profile page.
        
        Additionally, plonesocial.network provides ``@@following`` and ``@@followers`` views
        that enable exploration of the social graph.
        
        Core rendering logic is factored into two content providers, ``maxiprofile_provider``
        and ``miniprofile_provider``. This enables and promotes code re-use across different views.
        
        All browser views are anchored on the Site Root, so technically there's no user context
        in the form of a Member folder required.
        
        For a full social networking stack, install `plonesocial.suite`_.
        
        bugs
        ----
        
        Uninstalling either `plonesocial.microblog`_ or plonesocial_network removes both utilities, deleting all data.
