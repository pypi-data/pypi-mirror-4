Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This products uses jarn.checkinterval product to calculate the 
        value of the python-check-interval option in Zope's configuration.
        
        It's integrated into zc.buildout process, so it's just a 3 line add
        to your buildout, and each time you run it, you'll get the correct
        value for your setup, so no more need to execute manually the script.
        
        Configuration
        ==============
        
        Add a part in your buildout file pointing to this recipe before
        the part that creates the Zope instance, as follows::
        
          [buildout]
          parts = 
              ...
              checkinterval
              instance
              ...
        
          [checkinterval]
          recipe = cs.recipe.checkinterval
        
        And then, just use the value provided by the recipe in your instance part::
        
          [instance]
          ...
          python-check-interval = ${checkinterval:value}
          ...
        
        And that's it.
