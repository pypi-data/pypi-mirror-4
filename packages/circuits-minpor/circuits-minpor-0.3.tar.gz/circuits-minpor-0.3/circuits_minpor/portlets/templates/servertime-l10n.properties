ServerTimePortletHelp = This portlet demonstrates the usage of the event \
    exchange channel. If the checkbox is checked, an event is sent to \
    the server that starts a timer. Every second, this timer generates an \
    event with the current server side timestamp. The event is propagated \
    to the browser and the corresponding time is displayed.
TimeUpdateOn = Automatic update activated.
