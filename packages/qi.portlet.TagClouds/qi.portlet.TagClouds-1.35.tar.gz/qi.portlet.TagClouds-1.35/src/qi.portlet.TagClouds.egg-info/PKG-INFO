Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        qi.portlet.TagClouds is a plone product that adds tag cloud portlet support. The following parameters of the portlet are configurable through the web:
        
        * portlet title
        * number of different tag sizes
        * maximum tags to show
        * content types searched (optionally)
        * tags (subjects) searched (optionally)   
        * section of the site to be searched
        * workflow states searched
        * filtering by keywords so that a tag cloud of all keywords that are combined
          with the filter keywords is shown
        
        qi.portlet.TagClouds also comes with a simple caching mechanism. Cache remains
        valid for a time interval that can be set in the portlet settings.

        ----
        * The product is now accompanied with proper tests. [ggozad]
        * Added filtering by keyword. Thanks to lzdych for the idea and 
          discussions. [ggozad]
        * All important parameters (workflow states, portal types and search path) 
          are now present in the search links. [ggozad]
