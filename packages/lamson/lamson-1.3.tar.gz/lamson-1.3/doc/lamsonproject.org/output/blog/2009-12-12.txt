Title: Lamson 1.0pre9 Is Out

*UPDATE*: This used to be an announce for 1.0pre8, but python-daemon apparently has a bug that makes it not honor
the TERM signal (still) so I had to go back to HUP.

I just got done knocking down all the bugs in the new "Fossil":http://fossil-scm.org/ based
"Lamson Support Site":http://support.lamsonproject.org/ and cooked up 1.0pre9.  This has a 
ton of fixes, but I'll let the ChangeLog speak for itself:

</pre>

This closed out a bunch of bugs, so if you entered a bug in then go make sure that it's actually working for you.

h2. Getting This Release

As usual, you should be able to install it with PIP or easy_install, and you can get the raw downloads from
the "releases":/releases/ section of the site.

h2. Submitting Bugs

Keep in mind that this isn't as heavily tested as other releases, so if you hit a bug, "report it":http://support.lamsonproject.org/
and I'll fix it.  Even better, if you supply a patch then I'll consider giving you commit rights.


h2. Potential Contributors

Most of the changes were from supplied patches, and if you supplied a patch and want to contribute
to Lamson, then contact me and I'll give you an account on the site so you can commit directly.
