   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to DemoPackage!
=======================================
DemoPackage as the name suggests is just a sample package aka tutorial to cover all the aspects of creating a python package. This package can be used as a base for development of other python libraries on top of it. 

With DemoPackage I have covered the basics of: 

1. Version control using git on `Github <http://www.github.com>`_.
2. Python Package creation and maintenance at `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
3. Python package installation using `Setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_.
4. Automatic Documentation using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.
5. Hosting the documentation using Github-pages and Readthedocs.org

I'll be updating the detailed instructions as soon as possible.
