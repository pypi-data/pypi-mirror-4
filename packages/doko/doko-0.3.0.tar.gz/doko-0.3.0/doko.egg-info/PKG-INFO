Description: doko (どこ)
        ===========
        
        A simple command-line utility (and Python module) to determine your current location.
        
        Doko is a clone of Victor Jalencas's `whereami <https://github.com/victor/whereami>`_ utility, but unlike whereami it supports multiple strategies for finding your location.
        
        Kudos to `Richo Healey <https://github.com/richo/>`_ for ideas and patches.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        To install just GeoIP support, run::
        
          $ pip install doko
        
        However, on OS X 10.6 (Mountain Lion) or later, you can also use the much more accurate Core Location framework::
        
          $ pip install doko[corelocation]
        
        Using Core Location
        -------------------
        
        Once you've installed the corelocation-enabled doko package, you'll need to enable Core Location in System Preferences, in the "Security" or "Security & Privacy" section. Furthermore, you must be using Wifi for it to work.
        
        Hacking
        -------
        
        For hacking on OSX, you will likely want to install ``requires-corelocation.txt`` as well as ``requires.txt``.
        
        Linting the code is best done with `flake8 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8/>`_. The options used internally are ``--max-complexity=12 --ignore=E126,E123,E128``.
        
        Using on the command-line
        -------------------------
        
        Just run the ``doko`` command::
        
          $ doko
          35.674,139.701
        
        This will give its best guess as to your location, depending on the strategies that are available. Use the ``--show`` option to open the location in Google Maps.
        
        More fine-grained control over strategies used and the precision returned is available. See ``doko --help``.
        
        Using as a module
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
          > import doko
          > doko.location('geoip')  # on any platform
          Location(latitude=35.674, longitude=139.701, source='geoip')
          > doko.location('corelocation')  # on OS X, using Core Location
          Location(latitude=35.674851, longitude=139.701419, source='corelocation')
          > doko.Location.set_precision(2)
          > doko.location()
          Location(latitude=35.67, longitude=139.70, source='corelocation')
        
        Landmarks
        ---------
        
        You can use the ``doko-landmark`` command to store known landmarks, which you can then specify to doko using the ``DOKO_LANDMARK`` environment variable. This is useful if you're somewhere you go often without GPS::
        
          $ doko-landmark --add ueno-park 35.713965 139.77411
          $ doko-landmark --list
          ueno-park [35.713965, 139.77411]
          $ doko  # will give its best guess
          35.674851,139.70141
          $ DOKO_LANDMARK=ueno-park doko  # will use the landmark
          35.713965,139.77411
