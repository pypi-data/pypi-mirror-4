        ***************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jCrop`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jCrop`: https://github.com/tapmodo/Jcrop/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_jcrop``) are published to some URL.
        
        Packaging
        =========
        
        The packaging is stored on GitHub at
        https://github.com/davidjb/js.jquery_jcrop. If you happen to come across a bug
        that corresponds to *packaging*, then please report it here. Pull requests are
        more than welcome if you're fixing something yourself -- the more help the
        better!
        
        Any other bugs that relate to the library itself should be directed to the
        original developers.
        
        Updating this package
        ---------------------
        
        In order to obtain a newer version of `jCrop`_ for this library,
        do the following::
        
            git clone https://github.com/davidjb/js.jquery_jcrop.git
            pushd js.jquery_jcrop/js/jquery_jcrop/resources
            wget https://github.com/tapmodo/Jcrop/tarball/v0.9.10 -O jcrop.tgz
            tar xf jcrop.tgz --strip=2
            rm -rf *.php *.html demo_files jcrop.tgz jquery.min.js
            popd
            #Edit changelog, setup.py for versions, etc
            git commit -a -m "Updated for release 0.9.10"
            git push
        
        If you're doing this out in your own fork of the GitHub repository, then
        send through a pull request so everyone can benefit.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can import ``jquery_jcrop`` from ``js.jquery_jcrop`` and ``need`` it where
        you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_jcrop import jquery_jcrop
          >>> jquery_jcrop.need()
        
        and this will automatically include all the jCrop CSS and JavaScript resources
        for you.  We also provide a minified version of the resources for when
        you want to move your code into production and reduce page weight.  These
        latter libraries are automagically included for you thanks to Fanstatic when
        you turn on minification.
