record-activity-task-heartbeat
******************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Used by activity workers to report to the service that the
ActivityTask represented by the specified "--task-token" is still
making progress. The worker can also (optionally) specify --details of
the progress, for example percent complete, using the "--details"
parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism
to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task. If
a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the
boolean "cancelRequested" flag returned by the service is set to
"true" .

This action resets the "taskHeartbeatTimeout" clock. The
"taskHeartbeatTimeout" is specified in  register-activity-type .

This action does not in itself create an event in the workflow
execution history. However, if the task times out, the workflow
execution history will contain a "ActivityTaskTimedOut" event that
contains the information from the last heartbeat generated by the
activity worker.

Note: The "taskStartToCloseTimeout" of an activity type is the maximum
  duration of an activity task, regardless of the number of  record-
  activity-task-heartbeat requests received. The
  "taskStartToCloseTimeout" is also specified in register-activity-
  type .

Note: This operation is only useful for long-lived activities to report
  liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being
  attempted.

Warning: If the "cancelRequested" flag returns "true" , a cancellation is
  being attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should
  respond with respond-activity-task-canceled . Otherwise, it should
  ignore the cancellation request.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the domain name to limit the action to
  only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For --details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf record-activity-task-heartbeat
     --task-token <value>
     [--details <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--task-token"  (string)
   The "--task-token" of the  ActivityTask .

   Warning: The "--task-token" is generated by the service and should be
     treated as an opaque value. If the task is passed to another
     process, its "--task-token" must also be passed. This enables it
     to provide its progress and respond with results.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--details"  (string)
   If specified, contains --details about the progress of the task.
