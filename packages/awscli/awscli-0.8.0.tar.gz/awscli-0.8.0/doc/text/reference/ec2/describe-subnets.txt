describe-subnets
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your subnets. You can filter the results
to return information only about subnets that match criteria you
specify.

For example, you could ask to get information about a particular
subnet (or all) only if the subnet's state is available. You can
specify multiple filters (e.g., the subnet is in a particular VPC, and
the subnet's state is available).

The result includes information for a particular subnet only if the
subnet matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following table
shows the available filters.


SYNOPSIS

   aws ec2 describe-subnets
     [--subnet-ids <value>]
     [--filters <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

None


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--subnet-ids"  (list of string)
   A set of one or more subnet IDs.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Subnets. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,
   see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      [
        {
          "values":
            ["string", ...],
          "name": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]
