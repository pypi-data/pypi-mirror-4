python-libusb1 is a Python wrapper for libusb-1.0

Supports all transfer types, both in synchronous and asynchronous mode.

URL:
  http://github.com/vpelletier/python-libusb1
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/libusb1

Requirements:
- Python [1] 2.4+ required, 2.6+ recommended
  Untested with Python 3.x (use 2to3 to convert)
  pypy[4] somewhat tested, 1.9 has one bug[5] affecting python-libusb which is
  fixed in their HG
- ctypes [2] (included in Python 2.5+)
- libusb-1.0 [3]
  libusbx should work, too

Compatibility:
python-libusb1 is expected to work on any OS supported by libusb. It can be
expected to work on:
- Linux
- Windows
  *not* libusb-win32 (this is libusb0.1, the old API)
- Cygwin
- OSX (macports, fink, homebrew)
- FreeBSD
  libusb reimplementation: http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libusb/
- OpenBSD

Contents:
- libusb1.py
  Bare ctype wrapper, inspired from library C header file.
- usb1.py
  Python-ish (classes, exceptions, ...) wrapper around libusb1.py .
  See docstrings (pydoc recommended) for usage.
- setup.py
  To package as python egg.
- stdeb.cfg
  To package as Debian package. See https://github.com/astraw/stdeb .
- testUSB1.py
  Very limited regression test, only testing functions which do not require a
  USB device.

Install:
python setup.py install
(you might need root access to do this)

History:
0.0.1
  Initial release
0.1.1
  Massive rework of usb1.py, making it more python-ish and fixing some
  memory leaks.
0.1.2
  Deprecate "transfer" constructor parameter to allow instance reuse.
0.1.3
  Some work on isochronous "in" transfers. They don't raise exceptions anymore,
  but data validity and python-induced latency impact weren't properly checked.
0.2.0
  Fix asynchronous configuration transfers.
  Stand-alone polling thread for multi-threaded apps.
  More libusb methods exposed on objects, including ones not yet part of
  released libusb versions (up to their commit 4630fc2).
  2to3 friendly.
  Drop deprecated USBDevice.reprConfigurations method.
0.2.1
  Add FreeBSD support.
0.2.2
  Add Cygwin support.
  OpenBSD support checked (no change).
0.2.3
  Add fink and homebrew support on OSX.
  Drop PATH_MAX definition.
  Try harder when looking for libusb.
1.0.0
  Fix FreeBSD ABI compatibility.
  Easier to list connected devices.
  Easier to terminate all async transfers for clean exit.
  Fix few segfault causes.
  pypy support.
