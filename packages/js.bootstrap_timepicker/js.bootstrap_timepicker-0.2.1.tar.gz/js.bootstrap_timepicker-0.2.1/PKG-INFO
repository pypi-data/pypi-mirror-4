        =======================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `Bootstrap Timepicker`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Bootstrap Timepicker`: http://jdewit.github.com/bootstrap-timepicker/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.bootstrap_timepicker``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        
        You can import ``bootstrap_timepicker`` from ``js.bootstrap_timepicker`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_timepicker import bootstrap_timepicker
          >>> bootstrap_timepicker.need()
        
        The above includes both CSS and JS in your page.  If only need the JS *or* the
        CSS you can also include them separately::
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_timepicker import bootstrap_timepicker_js
          >>> bootstrap_timepicker_js.need()
        
        or
        
          >>> from js.bootstrap_timepicker import bootstrap_timepicker_css
          >>> bootstrap_timepicker_css.need()
