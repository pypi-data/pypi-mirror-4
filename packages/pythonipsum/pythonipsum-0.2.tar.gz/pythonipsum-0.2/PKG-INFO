Description: pythonipsum
        ===========
        
        A Python-flavored lorem ipsum generator, inspired by the tragically-plain
        placeholder text on the beta of the new python.org.
        
        Huge thanks are owed to the [loremipsum][loremipsum] library that made this a
        fun and easy project to hack on during PyCon 2013!
