PEP-8 Naming Conventions
========================

Check the PEP-8 naming conventions.

This module provides a plugin for ``flint``, the Python code checker.

.. note::
   the project is renamed `pep8-naming <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mccabe>`_
   and provides a plugin to the `Flake8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`_
   checker version 2.0.
   The ``flint`` project is discontinued and merged into ``flake8``.
