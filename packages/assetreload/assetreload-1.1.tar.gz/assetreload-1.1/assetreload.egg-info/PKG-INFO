Description: AssetReload
        ===========
        
        AssetReload uses WebSockets to broadcast asset changes to the browser.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install with pip:
        
        	pip install assetreload
        
        If you don't have it installed, use `easy_install` instead.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once setup, `cd` into a directory you would like to monitor for changes and start the server by running `assetreload`.
        
        There are optional arguments:
        
        * `path` defines the directory to monitor (defaults to current directory)
        * `port` the port on which to start the server (defaults to 8888)
        
        E.g.
        
        	assetreload --path=~/mysite/ --port=8889
        
        
        ### In the browser
        
        Make a copy of `assetreload.js` in your project, and include the following:
        
        	<script id="assetreload" src="assetreload.js"></script>
        
        Changes to the current document or JavaScript trigger a page reload, but images and CSS can happen without. Configure your port to match the above by using `data-port` on the `script` tag.
        
        You can automatically generate `assetreload.js` into a directory of your choosing by running:
        
        	assetreload genscript
        
        
        ## Changelog

        * Added: error handling for incorrectly configured ports
        * Removed: need to specify a list of files to watch - files are now handled automatically
