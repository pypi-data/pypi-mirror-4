Introduction

information how to install various.

.. note ::

    You don't need to install everything here; only if you are using a validator
    needing a specific run-time installed. You'll get an error message
    when running VVV if you are lacking something.

Node
===================================

Node.js is required in order to run Javascripts from command line.

For installation instructions see how to install
`Node.js with your OS package manager <https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager>`_.


Python
===================================

Since VVV internally uses Python a working Python run-time is assumed to exist.
