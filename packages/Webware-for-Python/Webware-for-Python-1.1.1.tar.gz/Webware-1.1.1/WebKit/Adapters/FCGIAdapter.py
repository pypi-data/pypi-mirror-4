"""FCGIAdapter.py

FCGI Adapter for the WebKit application environment.

Note: FCGI for Webware is not available on Windows.

This script is started by the Web Server and is kept running.
When a request comes through here, this script collects information
about the request, puts it into a package, and then invokes the
WebKit Application to handle it.

Original CGI implementaion by Chuck Esterbrook.

FastCGI Implementation by Jay Love.
Based on threaded fcgi example "sz_fcgi" provided by Andreas Jung.


SETUP

To use this adapter, you must have a fastcgi capable web server.

For Apache, you'll need to add the following lines to your httpd.conf file, or
put them in another file and include that file in httpd.conf

# I have the file in my cgi-bin directory, but you might as well put it in html.
# the -host is the port it communicates on
# the path is from the SERVER ROOT

    FastCgiExternalServer ../cgi-bin/FCGIWebKit.py -host localhost:33333

    <Location /FCGIWebKit.py> # or whatever name you chose for the file above
     SetHandler fastcgi-script
     Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    </Location>

You could also take an extension oriented approach in Apache using '.fcgi':

    AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi

And then using, in your URLs, 'WebKit.fcgi' which is a link to this file. e.g.,:

    http://localhost/Webware/WebKit/WebKit.fcgi/Introspect


FUTURE

(*) There are some interesting lines at the top of fcgi.py:

# Set various FastCGI constants
# Maximum number of requests that can be handled
FCGI_MAX_REQS=1
FCGI_MAX_CONNS = 1

# Boolean: can this application multiplex connections?
FCGI_MPXS_CONNS=0

Do these need to be adjusted in order to realize the full benefits of FastCGI?

(*) Has anyone measured the performance difference between CGIAdapter and FCGIAdapter? What are the results?

JSL- It's twice as fast as straight CGI


CHANGES

* 2000-05-08 ce:
  * Fixed bug in exception handler to send first message to stderr, instead of stdout
  * Uncommented the line for reading 'adapter.address'
  * Switched from eval() encoding to marshal.dumps() encoding in accordance with AppServer
  * Increased rec buffer size from 8KB to 32KB
  * Removed use of pr() for feeding app server results back to webserver. Figure that's slightly more efficient.
  * Added notes about how I set this up with Apache to what was already there.

*2001-03-14 jsl:
  * Fixed problem with post data
