create-security-group
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The create-security-group operation creates a new security group.

Every instance is launched in a security group. If no security group
is specified during launch, the instances are launched in the default
security group. Instances within the same security group have
unrestricted network access to each other. Instances will reject
network access attempts from other instances in a different security
group. As the owner of instances you can grant or revoke specific
permissions using the authorize-security-group-ingress and revoke-
security-group-ingress operations.
