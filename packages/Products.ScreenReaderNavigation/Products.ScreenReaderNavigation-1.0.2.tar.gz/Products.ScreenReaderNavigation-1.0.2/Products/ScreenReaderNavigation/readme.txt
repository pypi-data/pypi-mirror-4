Products.ScreenReaderNavigation is a simple product that provides
assistance for users of special navigation devices such as
screen readers.

It works by adding a start and end header to the navigation portlet so
that users can quickly navigate the page based on headers.  There has
to be a screenReaderHelp CSS class defined that only displays text for
example for the braille media type for this to work properly.  See
