<p>
<p>Introduction: pCanary basic purpose
<p>========================================
<p>
<p>pCanary is a opensource application that is used to lookup information on
<p>crafting and ores in the game Minecraft. It is written in Python and should
<p>be compatible with most operating systems however it has been built for
<p>Linux.
<br>
<p>pCanary will create a tk window that will become the interface of selecting
<p>different ores and recipes by the user. The tk window will give the user
<p>an idea on how to construct the crafting on a grid and it will also show
<p>the different ores and their purpose.
<p>
<p>pCanary was written by Jeremiah O'Neal aka we6jbo and is released under
<p>the GNU general public license
