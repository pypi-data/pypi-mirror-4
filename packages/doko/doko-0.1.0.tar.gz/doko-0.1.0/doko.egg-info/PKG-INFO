Description: doko (どこ)
        ===========
        
        A simple command-line utility (and module) to determine your current location, using Core Location, and optionally backing off to a web service.
        
        Doko is a Python clone of Victor Jalencas's `whereami <https://github.com/victor/whereami>`_ utility. It requires OS X 10.6 (Mountain Lion) or later to function.
        
        Kudos to `Rich Healey <https://github.com/richo/>`_ for getting me started.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install doko
        
        Enabling Core Location
        ----------------------
        
        On OS X 10.6 (Mountain Lion) or later, you can enable Core Location in System Preferences, in the "Security" or "Security & Privacy" section.
        
        Using on the command-line
        -------------------------
        
        Using Core Services alone, you can just run the ``doko`` command::
        
          $ doko
          35.674851 139.701419
        
        However, it relies on using wifi, and being enabled. If you won't have a wifi connection, you may see this::
        
          $ doko
          location could not be found -- is wifi enabled?
        
        In this case, you can back off to a much more approximate service based on your external IP with the ``--approx`` command::
        
          $ doko --approx
          35.674 139.701
        
        This may return the location for the center of the nearest city. To debug the location returned, the ``--show`` option will open a Google Maps browser window displaying the coordinates on a map.
        
        Using as a module
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
          > import doko
          > doko.location()
          Location(latitude=35.674851, longitude=139.701419)
          > doko.geobytes_location()  # approximate method
          Location(latitude=35.674, longitude=139.701)
