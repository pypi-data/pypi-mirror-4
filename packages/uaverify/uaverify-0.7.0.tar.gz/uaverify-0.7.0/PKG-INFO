Description: Urban Airship Verification
        ==========================
        
        Command line tools for verifying builds with Urban Airship. Two command line tools
        are installed, one for use with iOS builds, one for use with Android builds.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        The script is written against the default install of Python 2.7.2 installed on OS X 10.8.3.
        It's been designed to have no third party dependencies. Running on a previous version of
        Python has not been thoroughly tested, and my have issues. You can set the default
        Python version with the following command, see *man python* for more details
        ::
            defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.7
        
        Python Setup for Development
        ----------------------------
        
        If you want to work on the tools themselves, this is a useful install method.
        Run it from the root of the project repo::
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        If you want to take the tool out for a spin directly from the repository, this command will install
        it in your local bin::
        
            pip install -e "git+git@github.com:urbanairship/uaverify.git#egg=uaverify"
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        **Breaking changes from previous release**
        uaverify has now changed to uav-ios with the addition of the uav-android tool.
        
        This::
        
            uaverify /path/to/app
        
        is now::
        
            uav-ios /path/to/app
        
        
        **Standard usage for iOS**::
        
            uav-ios /path/to/app
        
        The path to the build output (the AppName.app) bundle is dependent on the Xcode build configuration.
        Please see the Xcode documentation for more details:
        
        http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/XcodeBuildSettingRef/0-Introduction/introduction.html
        
        **Standard usage for Android**::
        
            uav-android /path/to/project/directory
        
        Diagnostic usage for either tool::
        
            tool path -d
        
        The `-d` command line flag will product a diagnostic file by logging to stdout
        and a file at the same time with the additional step of appending the raw
        entitlements, API response, and AirshipConfig.plist data to the end of the
        file. You can append this file to support correspondence or bug reports.
