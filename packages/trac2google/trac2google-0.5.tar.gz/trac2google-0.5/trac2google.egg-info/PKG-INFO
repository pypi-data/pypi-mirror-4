Description: Running it the first time will create a new file in your home, called 
        .gcalendar. You need to fill in your google account details, your trac 
        id and the name of the calendar that contains your timesheet.
        
        IMPORTANT: this script only processes one month, it will not 
        record timesheet entries in other months, so it is best if you run this 
        in cron, daily, at some convenient hour when you've finished your work.
        
        You can call it with an argument from the command, line, giving
        it the number of the month that you want it to process.
