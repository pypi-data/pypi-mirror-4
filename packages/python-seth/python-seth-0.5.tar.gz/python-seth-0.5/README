python-seth is a pretty simple object named Daemon used to daemonize a process.

To do so subclass the Daemon object and override its run method with the code
you want to turn into a unix daemon.

You can override the shutdown method which is called on Daemon stop (either via
the stop method or on SIGTERM).

Cf. examples for code snippet.


FEATURES:
	* redirects stderr|stdout to file
	* writes a pid file
	* transparently deletes the pid file at stop
	* catch SIGTERM and handles a clean stop via shutdown method
