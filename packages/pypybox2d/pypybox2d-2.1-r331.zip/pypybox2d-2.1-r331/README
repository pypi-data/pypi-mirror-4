pypybox2d
---------
Pure Python physics
http://pybox2d.blogspot.com/

If you want the truly pure Python version, set build_cext to False in setup.py.
Otherwise, installation will require a working C compiler.

Installation:
> python setup.py install
Alternatively, you can copy the pypybox2d directory into testbed or examples and it should
also work.

Examples in testbed (requires pygame).
