Description: # Assembler for the 68112D microprocessor
        
        The 68112D is a clone of the 68HC11 microcontroller, with extra instructions
        to generate 2D graphics on a VGA display.
        
        The **asm2d** assembler turns the assembly code into VHDL code to synthesise
        a memory using an array of 8 bit vectors.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Using pip:
        
        ``` bash
        pip install asm2d
        ```
        
        ### For development
        
        ``` bash
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        ## Running
        
        Compile a file:
        
        ``` bash
        asm2d source.s
        ```
        
        The default output file will have the same name as the source file, but with
        a `.vhd` extension. You can change this with the `-o` flag:
        
        ```
        asm2d source.s -o memory.vhd
        ```
        
        ### Help
        
        ``` bash
        asm2d -h
        ```
