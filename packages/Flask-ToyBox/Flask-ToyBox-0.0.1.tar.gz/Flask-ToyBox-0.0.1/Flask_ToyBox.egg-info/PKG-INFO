        ============
        
        Sorry, no documentation yet, this is totally **pre-alpha** quality.
        
        I just needed something to implement somehow RESTful (or, to be precise, what
        I consider RESTful) API. I've looked around for a readily available solution,
        but didn't found anything that suited my needs and desires. So I've wrote a
        hopefully reusable library to do it.
        
        See feature list below for main points about this library.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        What's implemented:
        
        - Extensible (de)serialization for both input and output, with HTTP content-type
          negotiation.
        - Handling of GET and PATCH requests (object retrieval and modification)
        - Relatively flexible field-level permissions. Could be always supplemented by
          TastyPie-like hydration/dehydration methods.
        - SQLAlchemy model helpers.
        
        What's missing:
        
        - Examples.
        - Documentation. There are some docstrings in source code, but not much.
        - POST, PUT and DELETE requests (object creation and deletion).
        - Overriding negotiation using query string (i.e. `?format=json`)
        - Pagination helpers. Pagination is possible, but you have to do it by hand.
        - Nested resources.
        - Better test coverage.
