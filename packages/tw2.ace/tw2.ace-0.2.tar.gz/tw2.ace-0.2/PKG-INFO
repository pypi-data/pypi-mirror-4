        =======
        
        tw2.ace is a widget library for the ToscaWidgets 2 framework,
        which provides a JavaScript-based source code editor using the
        `ACE`_ JavaScript application.
        
        .. _ACE: http://ace.ajax.org/
        
        This library is merely a convenience for using ACE through tw2,
        all major credit goes to the developers of ACE.
        See also their repository at https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace
        
        This package comes bundled with ACE from 11.05.2012, which is released
        under a BSD-3-Clause license.
        This package itself is licensed under the WTFPL, Version 2 (for the moment).
        
        The directory ``ace-builds`` is a git submodule, but you don't have to
        check it out if you want to use tw2.ace! It is only included as a convenience
        for updating the bundled libraries.
