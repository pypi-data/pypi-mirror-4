Description: This package contains functions useful for general scientific
        programming, with a focus on astronomical research. The documentation
        details everything that is available, but some example tasks that can
        be handled are:
        
          * Calculate absorption profiles for various ions observed in
            astrophysical environments.
          * Fit a smooth continuum to a spectrum with many emission or
            absorption features.
          * Find the expected broad-band magnitudes given a spectral energy
            distribution.
        
        More details are given in the documentation here:

        To install, either download the tarball from the pypi website and then
        do::
        
          python setup.py install
        
        You may need to put a 'sudo' in front of this. 
        
        A better way to install (which allows for easy uninstallation) is by
        using pip::
        
          pip install barak
        
        but you need to have pip
        (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html) installed.
         
        To run the tests you need py.test
        (http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html) installed.  Then run::
        
           py.test barak 
        
        from this directory.

        Change Log
        ----------
        v0.3.1 6th Jan 2013 -- Minor docs changes for PyPI.
        
        v0.3.0 6th Jan 2013 -- WARNING - there are several API changes compared
           to version 0.2.x. 
        
         - The extinction module has been overhauled (with API changes),
           curves are now given as A(lambda)/A(V) instead of
           E(lambda-V)/E(B-V) and use an ExtinctionCurve class.  
        
         - Added a new module for calculating virial quantities, barak.virial.
        
         - Added a new uv QSO template.
         
         - make_constant_dv_wa_scale moved from barak.spec to barak.sed,
           convolve_constant_dv moved from barak.spec to barak.convolve.
          
         - Added new IR sed templates from Assef et al. 2010.  
        
         - Many other minor enhancements and bug fixes.
        
         - The astropy package is now a requirement (needed for the cosmology
           package and some utilities).
        
        v0.2.1, 19th Oct 2012 -- Fixed problems with the PyPI upload.
        
        v0.2.0, Oct 2012 -- Initial release.
