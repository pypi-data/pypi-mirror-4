giftwrap
========

A general API wrapper toolset to simply wrapping of any API, and embed it within objects.  

It takes care of all the work it can to minimize the work you have to do: 
* robust error handling 
* input/output manipulations (json,xml,etc)
* enabling easy bulk async calling while still allowing object embedding.
