Q: I just got a message like:

mount_osxfusefs: failed to mount /private/tmp/vospace@/dev/osxfuse0:
Connection refused

What does this mean?

A: Likely you authentication certificat has expired.  Use the
'getCert' command to pull a new cert and try again.  If the message
doesn't go away, please contact CADC for help fixxing your
authentication issue.
