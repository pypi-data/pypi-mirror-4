deprecate-workflow-type
***********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deprecates the specified *workflow type* . After a workflow type has
been deprecated, you cannot create new executions of that type.
Executions that were started before the type was deprecated will
continue to run. A deprecated workflow type may still be used when
calling visibility actions.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Constrain the following parameters by using a "Condition" element
  with the appropriate keys.

* "workflowType.name" : String constraint. The key is
  "swf:workflowType.name" .

* "workflowType.version" : String constraint. The key is
  "swf:workflowType.version" .

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
