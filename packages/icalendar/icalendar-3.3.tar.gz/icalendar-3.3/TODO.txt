Todo
====

- Check and Fix VTIMEZONE component functionality and creating VTIMEZONE
  components from tzinfo instances.

- Use @static instead of staticmethod (possibly breaks backwards
  compatibility?)

- Automatic encoding and decoding of parameter values. Most of the
  work is done already. Just need to get it finished. Look at line 153
  in 'src/icalendar/parser.py'
