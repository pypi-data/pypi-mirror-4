The package **rtools** provides utilities that are of general usage
for developing software that use the rpy2 package. It provides utilities that
are indeed related to the R language. This is not a replacement of
RPY2 but rather an addon that main goal is to simplify the life of developers
who are using R packages from Python. See
`http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~cokelaer/rtools`_ for exampes.
