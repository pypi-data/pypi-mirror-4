Description: pyroma
        ======
        
        Pyroma rhymes with aroma, and is a product aimed at giving a rating of how well
        a Python project complies with the best practices of the Python packaging
        ecosystem, primarily PyPI, pip, Distribute etc, as well as a list of issues that
        could be improved.
        
        The aim of this is both to help people make a project that is nice and usable,
        but also to improve the quality of Python third-party software, making it easier
        and more enjoyable to use the vast array of available modules for Python.
        
        It's written so that there are a library with methods to call from Python, as
        well as a script, also called pyroma.
        
        It can be run on a project directory before making a release:
        
            $ pyroma .
            
        On a distribution before uploading it to the CheeseShop:
        
            $ pyroma pyroma-1.0.tar.gz
        
        Or you can give it a package name on CheeseShop:
        
            $ pyroma pyroma
        
        In all cases the output is similar::

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 (2013-03-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Removed the running of tests. I always found it a bit iffy, and getting
          rid of it solved a lot of issues. Pyroma is now focused solely on
          packaging quality.
          
        - A package on PyPI with several versions will no longer return an error.
        
        - Now looks for documentation on pythonhosted.org or readthedocs.org.
        
        - Adds a hook for zest.releaser, so it can be run after doing the checkout,
          before uploading to PyPI.
        
        
        1.1 (2013-03-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Better handling if there is no package data, for example if setup.py doesn't
          call setup() unless you run it as the "__main__" script.
          
        - If setup.py doesn't call setup() look for a main() script and try to run it.
        
        
        1.0 (2013-03-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Support for Python 3.3
        
        - Added test for PEP 386 compliance.
        
        
        0.9.3 (2011-03-17)
        ------------------
        
        - It's now using a ProxyStub for the PyPI xmlrpclib during tests.
        
        - Removed the Dependency rating.
        
        - Added a rating that runs tests, to see if they run. This will also take
          care of checking for dependencies.
        
        
        0.9.2 (2011-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Commented out the dependency test, it was too unreliable.
        
        - Fixed the ReST.
        
        - Python 3 support.
        
        
        0.9.1 (2011-03-08)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release
