"""
Perimeter is an app that provides middleware (and associated models etc.) that
allow you to 'secure the perimeter' of your django site outside of any existing
auth process that you have.

Why?

Most django sites have some kind of user registration and security model - a
login process, decorators to secure certain URLs, user accounts - everything
that comes with django.contrib.auth and associated apps (django-registration).
Sometimes, however, you want to simply secure the entire site tp prevent prying
eyes - the classic example being before a site goes live. You want to erect a
secure perimeter fence around the entire thing. If you have control over your
front-end web server (e.g. Apache, Nginx) then this can be used to do this using
their in-built access control features. However, if you are running your app on
a hosting platform you may not have admin access to these parts. That's when you
need Perimeter.

Perimeter provides simple tokenised access control over your entire Django site.
It consists of two parts: admin site functionality to create a new access token,
and middleware to control the access based on said token.

How does it work?

Once you have installed and enabled Perimeter, everyone requiring access will
need an authorisation token (NB this is not authentication). To create a new
token you need to head to the admin site, and to create a new token under the
Perimeter app. The token has a number of properties:

* Recipient email - tokens are bound to a single email address. This is not
    checked per se, however it allows us to log usage, just in case things get
    hairy down the line. (CYA)
* Expiry - token automatically expire after a certain period - set this to a
    date / time in the future.
* Token - this is the token that the user must append to the URL that they get.
    It is not auto-generated, but must be unique.

Once the user has the token (you'll need to give it to them yourself), they can
visit the site. The Perimeter middleware, if enabled, will check a user's
querystring or session for 'pt' argument. If it's found on the querystring,
then it's validated (from db) and added to the user's session. The first time
that it's used in a session the usage is recorded, along with client IP and
user agent (for reference purposes).

Setup

1. Add 'yunojuno.apps.perimeter' to your installed apps.
2. Add 'yunojuno.apps.perimeter.middleware.PerimeterAccessMiddleware' to the list
    of MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
3. Add PERIMETER_ENABLED=True to your settings file. This setting can be used to
    enable or disable Perimeter in different environments.
