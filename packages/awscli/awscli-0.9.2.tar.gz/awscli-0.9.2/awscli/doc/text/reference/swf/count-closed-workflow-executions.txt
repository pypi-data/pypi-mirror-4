count-closed-workflow-executions
********************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the number of closed workflow executions within the given
--domain that meet the specified filtering criteria.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Constrain the following parameters by using a "Condition" element
  with the appropriate keys.

* "tag" : String constraint. The key is "swf:tagFilter.tag" .

* "typeFilter.name" : String constraint. String constraint. The key is
  "swf:typeFilter.name" .

* "typeFilter.version" : String constraint. String constraint. The key
  is "swf:typeFilter.version" .

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf count-closed-workflow-executions
     --domain <value>
     [--type-filter <value>]
     [--tag-filter <value>]
     [--close-time-filter <value>]
     [--close-status-filter <value>]

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The name of the --domain containing the workflow executions to
   count.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--type-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, indicates the type of the workflow executions to be
   counted.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "version"  (string)

   "name"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "version": "string",
        "name": "string"
      }

"--tag-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only executions that have a tag that matches the
   filter are counted.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "tag"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "tag": "string"
      }

"--close-time-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions that meet the close time
   criteria of the filter are counted.

   Note: "--start-time-filter" and "--close-time-filter" are mutually
     exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not
     both.

   "oldest_date"  (timestamp)

   "latest_date"  (timestamp)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "oldest_date": timestamp,
        "latest_date": timestamp
      }

"--close-status-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions that match this close status
   are counted. This filter has an affect only if "executionStatus" is
   specified as "CLOSED" .

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "status"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "status": "COMPLETED"|"FAILED"|"CANCELED"|"TERMINATED"|"CONTINUED_AS_NEW"|
        "TIMED_OUT"
      }

"--start-time-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions that meet the start time
   criteria of the filter are counted.

   Note: "--start-time-filter" and "--close-time-filter" are mutually
     exclusive. You must specify one of these in a request but not
     both.

   "oldest_date"  (timestamp)

   "latest_date"  (timestamp)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "oldest_date": timestamp,
        "latest_date": timestamp
      }

"--execution-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions matching the "WorkflowId" in
   the filter are counted.

   Note: "--close-status-filter" , "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter"
     and "--tag-filter" are mutually exclusive. You can specify at
     most one of these in a request.

   "workflow_id"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "workflow_id": "string"
      }
