        ## Introduction
        
        
        This idea is inspired by Git and Django, which assume projects are organized
        within a directory.  Many other applications and projects work this way, like
        Ruby on Rails and Maven.
        
        Many projects, like source code repositories, web applications, etc., store
        locations of code, configuration, scripts, virtual environments, etc., relative
        to the root directory of the project or application.
        
        When a script, application, executable, binary, program, or command is
        executed, it needs to find the root directory of the project it is supposed to
        operate on.  For example, `git status` only works when called from within
        a git repository.  Alternatively, a Django `manage.py` script can be run from
        anywhere, yet it knows to operate on the web application it is located within.
        
        There are two sub-organizing principles seen in project commands, based around
        how they find the root directory of the project:
        
        - In the "cwd" approach, exemplified by `git`, code and executables find the
          project based on the current working directory.  For example, to work in a
          git repository, one must first `cd` to somewhere in the repository directory
          tree.
        - In the "which" approach, exemplified by a django `manage.py` script, code and
          executables find the project based on the path of the executable itself.  For
          example, a django `manage.py` script expects to be located in the root of
          the project.
        
        An advantage of the "cwd" approach is that one set of binaries can be used
        with multiple projects.
        
        An advantages of the "which" approach are that one can run the binaries from
        anywhere.  Another advantage is that a different version of code/binaries can
        be associated with each project.  This can be useful for deployments of
        multiple version of an application.

        Feel free to make a pull request on github.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Probably Python 2.7 (since that is the only version it has been tested with.)
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        ### Install from pypi.python.org
        
        Download and install using pip:
        
            pip install projd
        
        
        ### Install from github.com
        
        Using github, one can clone and install a specific version of the package:
        
            cd ~
            git clone git@github.com:todddeluca/projd.git
            cd projd
            python setup.py install
        
        Or use pip:
        
            pip install git+git://github.com/todddeluca/projd.git#egg=projd
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are two functions for finding the root directory of a project based on
        that root directory containing a specific token, a file or directory.  One
        function works based on the current working directory.  
        
        For example to find the root directory of a git repository one would do:
        
            import projd
            root = projd.cwd_token_dir('.git')
        
        To find the root directory of a project containing the script being executed
        (similar to how a django manage.py file works), one would do:
        
            import projd
            root = projd.script_token_dir('.git')
