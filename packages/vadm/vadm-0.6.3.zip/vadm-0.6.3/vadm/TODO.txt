Future User-level Features
----------------------------

- have vadm create and handle local repositories including
  commit hooks and mail notifications, configurable via the command line 

- make vadm usable with remote URLs, as to have system configuration 
  sharable between multiple host.  See how that fits with
  locally managing a repo (just the point above). 

- better support for "auto commits": vadm could provide
  a regularly-runnable check script for comitting that might even 
  try to correlates log-in information and changes 

- remote management of servers: you don't have to login to
  check status, commit, update etc.
