        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the ``kotti_theme_cyborg`` theme in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste
        Deploy config.  If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option,
        add one.  The line in your ``[app:kotti]`` section could then look like
        this::
        
          kotti.configurators = kotti_theme_cyborg.kotti_configure
        
        With this, you'll be able to use TinyMCE in your Kotti site.
