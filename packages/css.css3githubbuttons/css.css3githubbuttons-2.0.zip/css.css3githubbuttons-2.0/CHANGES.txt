Changelog
*********


2.0 (2012-12-07)
================

- Switched to using CodeFusion's fork of necolas' GitHub buttons.
  See demo at http://demo.codefusionlab.com/css3-github-buttons/. As well as
  several fixes, this now provides disabled buttons, no text buttons, colours,
  more icons, and more sizes. Backwards compatibility should be maintained if
  you are not using new features (some extra CSS is introduced in the basic
  file).

  because of various pieces failing around them.
