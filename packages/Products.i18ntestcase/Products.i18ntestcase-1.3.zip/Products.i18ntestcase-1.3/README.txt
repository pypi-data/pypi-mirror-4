Products.i18ntestcase Readme

    Products.i18ntestcase is build on top of the ZopeTestCase package. It has
    been developed to simplify testing of gettext i18n files for Zope products.

    The Products.i18ntestcase package provides:

        - The class 'I18NTestCase' of which you can derive your own test cases.

        - The classes 'PoTestCase.py' and 'PotTestCase.py' which include a set
          of common tests for po and pot files.

        - The 'test_i18n.py' script, which you can put in your tests folder to
          easily use all these already written tests.

    Copying the test_i18n.py to your tests folder is the preferred way.
