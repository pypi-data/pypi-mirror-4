        ### Installation
        
        piprot can now be installed
        
            python setup.py install
        
        
        ### Basic Usage
        
        Just a heads up that this readme doesn't even scratch the surface of what's possible with this initial version of piprot.
        
        piprot will always use the first requirements file you include on the comand line
        
            piprot requirements.txt
        
        The -v arguement will make things a little more verbose
        
            piprot -v requirements.txt
        
        The -l or --lint will get angry at you about mistakes in your requirements file
        
            piprot --lint requirements.txt
        
        Yes, you can use stdin as well
        
            pip freeze | piprot -
        
        
        ### Tests
        
        To run the test suite, execute `python -m unittest discover`, within the project directory.
        
        Test coverage is pretty low at the moment.
