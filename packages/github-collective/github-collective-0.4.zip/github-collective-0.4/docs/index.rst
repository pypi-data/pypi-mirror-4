   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to github-collective's documentation!
====================================================

`GitHub organizations`_ are great way for collaborations, companies, and any
groups to manage their Git repositories. This tool will let you automate the
tedious tasks of creating teams, granting permissions, and creating
repositories or modifying their settings. This tool works by utilising the
GitHub JSON API to syncronise a local text-based (ini-style) configuration and
translate this into configuration for GitHub. This means you can use version
control (such as Git) to keep revisions of your configuration and in general,
reduce administrative overhead managing your repositories and teams.
