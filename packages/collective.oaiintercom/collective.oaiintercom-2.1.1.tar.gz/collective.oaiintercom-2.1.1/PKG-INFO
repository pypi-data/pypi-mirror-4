Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.oaiintercom is a product that extends a Plone site to 
        enable it to provide OAI-PMH metadata harvesting capabilites
        (http://www.openarchives.org/pmh). It provides metadtata information in 
        service requests to a Service Provider via the OAI-PMH v2.0 protocol 
        specification.
        
        Metadata requests are provided through a top level view (/oai) and must
        follow the conventions listed in the specification (http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html).
        
        Once you have enabled this product you can test your Plone site using the 
        Repository Explorer (http://re.cs.uct.ac.za/).
