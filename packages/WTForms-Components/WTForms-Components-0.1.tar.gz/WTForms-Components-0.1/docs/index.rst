WTForms-Components
==================

WTForms-Components provides various additional fields, validators and widgets
for WTForms.

Fields
======

While the main purpose of WTForms-Alchemy is to provide a bridge between SQLAlchemy
models and WTForms forms. It also provides some additional fields and validators missing
from WTForms.

SelectField
-----------

This SelectField provides support for optgroups.

Validators
==========

DateRange validator
-------------------

The DateRange validator is essentially the same as wtforms.validators.NumberRange validator but validates
dates.

In the following example we define a start_time field, which does not accept dates in the past. ::

    from datetime import datetime
    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import DateField
    from wtforms_alchemy import DateRange

    class EventForm(Form):
        start_time = DateField(
            validators=[DateRange(min=datetime.now())]
        )

If validator
------------

The If validator provides means for having conditional validations. In the following example we only
validate field email if field user_id is provided. ::


    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import IntegerField, TextField
    from wtforms_alchemy import If

    class SomeForm(Form):
        user_id = IntegerField()
        email = TextField(validators=[
            If(lambda form, field: field.user_id.data, Email())
        ])


Chain validator
---------------


Chain validator chains validators together. Chain validator can be combined with If validator
to provide nested conditional validations. ::


    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import IntegerField, TextField
    from wtforms_alchemy import If

    class SomeForm(Form):
        user_id = IntegerField()
        email = TextField(validators=[
            If(
                lambda form, field: field.user_id.data,
                Chain(DataRequired(), Email())
            )
        ])
