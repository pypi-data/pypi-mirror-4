         Hieroglyph
        ============
        
        **Hieroglyph** is an extension for `Sphinx`_ which builds HTML5 slides
        from ReStructured Text documents.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        You can install **Hieroglyph** using ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::
        
           $ easy_install hieroglyph
        
        You can also download the `latest development version`_, which may
        contain new features.
        
        Using Hieroglyph
        ================
        
        Add **Hieroglyph** as a Sphinx extension to your configuration::
        
          extensions = [
              'hieroglyph',
          ]
        
        Build your slides::
        
          $ sphinx-build -b slides sourcedir outdir
        
        Where ``sourcedir`` is the directory containing the Sphinx ``conf.py``
        file and ``outdir`` is where you want your slides to output to.
