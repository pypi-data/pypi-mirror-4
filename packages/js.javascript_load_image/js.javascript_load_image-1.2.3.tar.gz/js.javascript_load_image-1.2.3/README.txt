js.javascript_load_image
========================

Introduction
------------

This library packages `JavaScript Load Image`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`JavaScript Load Image`: http://blueimp.github.com/JavaScript-Load-Image/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.javascript_load_image``) are published to some URL.
