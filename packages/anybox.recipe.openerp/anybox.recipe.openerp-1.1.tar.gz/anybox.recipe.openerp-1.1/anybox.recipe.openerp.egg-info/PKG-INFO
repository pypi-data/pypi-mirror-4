Description: anybox.recipe.openerp
        =====================
        
        This is a `Buildout <https://github.com/buildout/buildout>`_ recipe for
        downloading, installing and configuring one or several OpenERP servers, web
        clients and/or gtk clients. It currently supports versions 6.0 and 6.1, custom
        branches, custom addons and gunicorn deployment. For a quickstart you can
        jump to the example section.

        Recipes
        ~~~~~~~
        
        You get 3 recipes at once. The recipe to use is the following:
        
        For the server::
        
            recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:server
        
        For the web client::
        
            recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:webclient
        
        For the gtk client::
        
            recipe = anybox.recipe.openerp:gtkclient
        
        Default options from zc.recipe.egg
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This recipe reuses the *zc.recipe.egg:scripts* recipe, so the options
        are the same (*eggs*, *interpreter*, etc.), and some changes, documented below.
        
        Consult the documentation here http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg/1.3.2
        
        The main useful ones are below:
        
        eggs
        ----
        
        Starting from version 0.16 of the recipe, you don't need to put anything in
        this option by default.  But you may specify additional eggs needed by addons,
        or just useful ones::
        
            eggs = 
                ipython
                openobject-library
        
        scripts
        --------
        
        The behaviour of this option is slightly modified :
        by default, no script other than those directly related to OpenERP are
        generated, but you may specify some explicitely, with the same semantics as the
        normal behaviour (we simply set an empty default value, which means to not
        produce scripts)::
        
                scripts =
                    change_tz
        
        In the current state, beware to *not* require the same script in different
        parts or rename them. See
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/anybox.recipe.openerp/+bug/1020967 for details.
        
        interpreter
        -----------
        
        This is the default `interpreter` option of `zc.recipe.egg` that specifies the name 
        of the Python interpreter that shoud be included in the ``bin`` directory of the buildout::
        
            interpreter = erp_python
        
        
        Specific options
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The recipe also adds a few specific options:
        
        version
        -------
        
        Specifies the OpenERP version to use. It can be:
        
        The **version number** of an official OpenERP (server, web client or gtk client)::
        
          version = 6.0.3
        
        A **custom download**::
        
          version = url http://example.com/openerp.tar.gz
        
        An absolute or a relative **path**::
        
          version = path /my/path/to/a/custom/openerp
        
        A custom **bzr, hg, git or svn** branch or repository. The syntax is the same
        as the `addons` option (see below)::
        
          version = bzr lp:openobject-server/6.1 openerp61 last:1
        
        A **nightly** build::
        
          version = nightly 6.1 20120814-233345
        
        or (dangerous)::
        
          version = nightly 6.1 latest
        
        
        addons
        ------
        
        Specifies additional addons, either a local path or a repository.
        
        Example::
        
          addons = local ../some/relative/path/for/custom_addons/
                   local /some/other/absolute/path/for/custom_addons
                   bzr lp:openobject-addons/trunk/    addons0 last:1
                   hg  http://example.com/some_addons addons1 default
                   git http://example.com/some_addons addons2 master
                   svn http://example.com/some_addons addons3 head
                   bzr lp:openerp-web/trunk/ openerp-web last:1 subdir=addons
        
        When using ``local`` paths you can either specify a directory holding
        addons, or a single one. In that latter case, it will be actually
        placed one directory below
            
        For remote repositories the syntax is:
        
        ``TYPE  URL  DESTINATION  REVISION  [OPTIONS]``
        
        * *TYPE* can be ``bzr``, ``hg``, ``git`` or ``svn``
        * *URL* is any URL scheme supported by the versionning tool
        * *DESTINATION* is the local directory that will be created (relative or absolute)
        * *REVISION* is any version specification supported (revision, tag, etc.)
        * *OPTIONS* take the form ``name=value``. Currently, only the ``subdir``
          option is recognized. If used, the given subdirectory of the
          repository is registered as an addons directory.
        
        Repositories are updated on each build according to the specified
        revision. You have to be careful with the revision specification.
        
        Buildout offline mode is supported. In that case, update to the
        specified revision is performed, if the VCS allows it (Subversion does not).
        
        script_name
        -----------
        
        Startup scripts are created in the `bin` directory. By default the name is:
        start_<part_name>, so you can have several startup scripts for each part if you
        configure several OpenERP servers or clients. You can pass additional typical
        arguments to the server via the startup script, such as -i or -u options.
        
        You can choose another name for the script by using the *script_name*
        option ::
        
            script_name = start_erp  
        
        startup_delay
        -------------
        
        Specifies a time in seconds to wait within the startup
        script before actually launching OpenERP. The Gunicorn startup script (see
        below) is not affected by this setting ::
        
            startup_delay = 3
        
        with_devtools
        -------------
        
        Allows to load development and useful testing tools, such as
        ``anybox.testing.datetime``. False by default::
        
            with_devtools = true
        
        base_url
        --------
        
        URL to download official and nightly versions from
        (assuming the archive filenames are constistent with those in
        OpenERP download server). This is a basic mirroring capability::
        
            base_url = http://download.example.com/openerp/
        
        openerp-downloads-directory
        ---------------------------
        
        Specifies the destination download directory for OpenERP archives. The path may
        be absolute or relative to thebuildout directory.  By setting it in your
        ``default.cfg``, you may share the downloads among different buildouts.
        
        Example::
        
            [buildout]
            openerp-downloads-directory = /home/user/.buildout/openerp-downloads
        
        gunicorn
        --------
        
        Gunicorn integration is only supported on OpenERP >= 6.1
        This options allow to generate a script to start OpenERP with Gunicorn.
        It currently support two values: ``direct`` and ``proxied``
        
        Direct mode
        ```````````
        Direct mode should be used to let Gunicorn serve requests directly::
        
            gunicorn = direct
        
        Proxied mode
        ````````````
        
        Use this mode if you plan to run Gunicorn behind a reverse proxy::
        
            gunicorn = proxied
        
        Gunicorn options
        ````````````````
        
        Gunicorn-specific options are to be specified with the ``gunicorn.``
        prefix and will end up in the the Gunicorn python configuration file
        ``etc/gunicorn_<part_name>.conf.py``, such as::
        
          gunicorn.workers = 8
        
        If you don't specify ``gunicorn.bind``, then a value is constructed
        from the relevant options for the OpenERP script (currently
        ``options.xmlrpc_port`` and ``options.xmlrpc_interface``).
        
        Other supported options and their default values are::
        
          gunicorn.workers = 4
          gunicorn.timeout = 240
          gunicorn.max_requests = 2000
        
        Finally, you can specify the Gunicorn script name with the
        ``gunicorn_script_name`` option. The configuration file will be named
        accordingly.
        
        
        OpenERP options
        ---------------
        
        You can define OpenERP options directly from the buildout file.  The OpenERP
        configuration files are generated by OpenERP itself in the buildout `etc`
        directory during the first buildout run.  You can overwrite these options in
        from the recipe section of your buildout.cfg.  The options must be written
        using a dotted notation prefixed with the name of the section.  The specified
        options will just overwrite the existing options in the corresponding config
        files. You don't have to replicate all the options in your buildout.cfg.  If an
        option or a section does not exist in the openerp config file, it can be
        created from there.
        
        For example you can specify the xmlrpc port for the server or
        even an additional option that does not exist in the default config file::
        
          options.xmlrpc_port = 8069
          options.additional_option = "foobar"
        
        It will end-up in the server config as::
        
          [options]
          xmlrpc_port = 8069
          additional_option = "foobar"
        
        For the web client you can specify the company url with::
        
          global.server.socket_port = 8080
          openerp-web.company.url = 'http://anybox.fr'
        
        It will modify the corresponding web client config::
        
          [global]
          server.socket_port = 8080
        
          [openerp-web]
          company.url = 'http://anybox.fr'
        
        Example OpenERP 6.0 buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here is a sample buildout with versions specification, 2 OpenERP servers (with
        one using the latest 6.0 branch on the launchpad) using only NETRPC and
        listening on 2 different ports, and 2 web clients::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = openerp1 web1 openerp2 web2

        Example OpenERP 6.1 buildout
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here is a simple example for a stock OpenERP 6.1, with a GTK client, and a
        local addon you are developping for a client project
        
        .. note:: with OpenERP 6.1 the web client is natively included in the server as a
            simple module. In that case you don't need to write a separate part for the web
            client, unless that's what you really want to do.
