delete-db-instance
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The delete-db-instance API deletes a previously provisioned RDS
instance. A successful response from the web service indicates the
request was received correctly. If a final DBSnapshot is requested the
status of the RDS instance will be "deleting" until the DBSnapshot is
created. DescribeDBInstance is used to monitor the status of this
operation. This cannot be canceled or reverted once submitted.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws rds delete-db-instance
     --db-instance-identifier <value>
     [--final-db-snapshot-identifier <value>]
     [--skip-final-snapshot ]

   The DBSnapshotIdentifier of the new DBSnapshot created when --skip-
