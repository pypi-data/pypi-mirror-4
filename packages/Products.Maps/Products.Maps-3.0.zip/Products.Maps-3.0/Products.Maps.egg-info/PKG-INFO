Description: A Google Maps solution for Plone
        --------------------------------
        
        The main purpose of this product is to provide a very simple to use
        Google Maps integration for Plone. The following goals were set for
        development:
        
        - Ease of use
            - Add locations to a folder
            - Set the view of the folder to Map
            - It figures out how to center and zoom the map automatically
        - Flexibility for enhancement by using the Zope 3 component architecture
        - Sane fallbacks when Javascript is not available
        - Clean separation of javascript, templates and logic
        - Works on Topics
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Maps shows up in the "Add-ons" configuration panel.
        
        Implementing custom content with map field
        ------------------------------------------
        
        If you want to add location foeld to your custom content type, you should
        implement the following steps:
        
        Add GeoLocation field::
        
            from Products.Maps.field import LocationWidget, LocationField
            from Products.Maps.interfaces import IMapEnabled, ILocation
        
            MyContentSchema = ...
        
                LocationField('geolocation',
                          required=False,
                          searchable=False,
                          validators=('isGeoLocation',),
                          widget = LocationWidget(label = u'Event location'),
                ),
                ... 
        
        Update your class definition::
        
            class MyContent(ATCTContent):
                """ my content description """
                implements(IMyContent, IMapEnabled, ILocation)
            
                ... 
        
                def getMarkerIcon(self):
                    """ Can be implemented as select field. See Maps.Location content """
                    return "Red Marker"
        
        Add following snippet to custom content view/template::
        
            <div class="googleMapView googleMapLocation"
                 tal:define="view context/@@maps_googlemaps_view">
                <dl metal:use-macro="here/maps_map/macros/markers">
                </dl>
            </div>

        - Add a metadata.xml to the GenericSetup profile.
          [wichert]
        
        - Refactored to make it easier to use Maps in custom content types. If you
          write a content type and use a field named 'geolocation', then you can use
          default implementations of adapters now instead of writing three on your own.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Moved to common egg file layout. This means there will be no more
          tarball releases, because the docs are outside of the Products folder.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Converted HISTORY.txt and README.txt to reStructureText.
          [fschulze]

          [hannosch]
        
        1.2 - July 3, 2008

        - Added greek translation.
          [ggozad]
        
        - Updated templates for Plone 3.0.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Dropped compatibility with Plone 2.5.
          [fschulze]
        
        1.1 - September 05, 2007
        ------------------------
        
        - Fixed the logic when to show layers.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed viewing of maps if the workflow state was 'private'. There is a
          new interface and view which only has the 'enabled' attribute and which
          is accessible without restriction. This is now used as the condition in
          portal_javascripts.
          [fschulze]
        
        - The coordinates field now uses a tuple with two floats everywhere. The
          widget for it now uses two input fields.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Made LinguaPlone aware.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added custom view for locations. The map is smaller at the upper right
          and the rich text is shown besides it.
          [fschulze]
        
        1.1rc1 - May 17, 2007
        ---------------------
        
        - Added configlet for Plone 3.0.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed scrolling of map when clicking on pin. This only happend when
          there were no layers.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed functionality of layer checkboxes for IE6/7.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Fixed key lookup when the URL has a trailing slash.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added fallback to Google AJAX Search if the Google Maps geocoding did
          not return any results. This allows you to search for cities i.e. the
          UK and China.
          [fschulze]
        
        1.0 - May 03, 2007
        ------------------
        
        - Changed the markup. All markers are in one definition list instead of
          one marker in one list. A dt with class="title" marks the beginning of
          a new marker.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for layers. The default is to take keywords as the name
          of the layer in which a marker is visible. Then you get a map control
          with checkboxes for each keyword and you can view/hide the markers with
          that.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Using GenericSetup for installation.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for existing qPloneGoogleMaps markers.
          Added support of content with location from the geolocation product.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added RichText field to Location objects.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Added support for tabbed info windows.
          [fschulze]
        
        
        0.5 - April 02, 2007
        --------------------
