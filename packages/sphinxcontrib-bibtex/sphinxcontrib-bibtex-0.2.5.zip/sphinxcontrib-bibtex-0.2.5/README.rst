A Sphinx extension for BibTeX style citations.

This extension allows `BibTeX <http://www.bibtex.org/>`_
citations to be inserted into documentation generated by
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, via
a ``bibliography`` directive, and a ``cite`` role, which
work similarly to LaTeX's ``thebibliography`` environment
and ``\cite`` command.

Inspired by
`bibstuff.sphinxext.bibref <https://github.com/matthew-brett/bibstuff>`_
by Matthew Brett.
