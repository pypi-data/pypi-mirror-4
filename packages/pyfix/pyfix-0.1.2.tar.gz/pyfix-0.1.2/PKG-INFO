        pyfix is a framework for writing and executing automated tests including unittests, integration tests or acceptance
        tests. pyfix provides capabilities similar to other tools (such as unittest) but does not follow the xUnit semantics
        to write tests.

        pyfix aims to make tests easy to read and understand while it encourages the use of accepted software design principles
        such as favor composition over inheritance. pyfix also tries to reduce the amount of syntactic "waste" that some other
        frameworks suffer from (i.e. putting self in front of almost everything).
