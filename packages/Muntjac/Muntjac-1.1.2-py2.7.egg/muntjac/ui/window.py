    """A component that represents an application (browser native) window or
    a sub window.

    If the window is a application window or a sub window depends on how it
    is added to the application. Adding a C{Window} to a C{Window}
    using L{Window.addWindow} makes it a sub window and adding a
    C{Window} to the C{Application} using
    L{Application.addWindow} makes it an application window.

    An application window is the base of any view in a Muntjac application. All
    applications contain a main application window (set using
    L{ApplicationsetMainWindow} which is what is initially shown
    to the user. The contents of a window is set using
    L{setContent}. The contents can in turn contain
    other components. For multi-tab applications there is one window instance
    per opened tab.

    A sub window is floating popup style window that can be added to an
    application window. Like the application window its content is set using
    L{setContent}. A sub window can be positioned on
    the screen using absolute coordinates (pixels). The default content of the
    Window is set to be suitable for application windows. For sub windows it
    might be necessary to set the size of the content to work as expected.

    Window caption is displayed in the browser title bar for application level
    windows and in the window header for sub windows.

    Certain methods in this class are only meaningful for sub windows and other
    parts only for application windows. These are marked using B{Sub window
    only} and B{Application window only} respectively in the API doc.

    be wary of filling the notification with too much information.

    The notification message tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, while
    still drawing needed attention. There are several basic types of messages
    that can be used in different situations:

      - TYPE_HUMANIZED_MESSAGE fades away quickly as soon as the user uses
        the mouse or types something. It can be used to show fairly unimportant
        messages, such as feedback that an operation succeeded ("Document
        Saved") - the kind of messages the user ignores once the application
        is familiar.

      - TYPE_WARNING_MESSAGE is shown for a short while after the user uses
        the mouse or types something. It's default style is also more
        noticeable than the humanized message. It can be used for messages that
        do not contain a lot of important information, but should be noticed by
        the user. Despite the name, it does not have to be a warning, but can
        be used instead of the humanized message whenever you want to make the
        message a little more noticeable.

      - TYPE_ERROR_MESSAGE requires to user to click it before disappearing,
        and can be used for critical messages.

      - TYPE_TRAY_NOTIFICATION is shown for a while in the lower left corner
        of the window, and can be used for "convenience notifications" that do
        not have to be noticed immediately, and should not interfere with the
        current task - for instance to show "You have a new message in your
        inbox" while the user is working in some other area of the application.

    In addition to the basic pre-configured types, a Notification can also be
    configured to show up in a custom position, for a specified time (or
    until clicked), and with a custom stylename. An icon can also be added.
