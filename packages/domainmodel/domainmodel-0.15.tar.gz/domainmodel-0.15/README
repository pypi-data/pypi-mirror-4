Welcome to DomainModel
++++++++++++++++++++++

DomainModel is an open-source framework for enterprise applications.

It uses existing patterns of enterprise applications such as Model-
View-Controller, Data Mapper, Registry, and Domain Model. Much reference to
the writings of Martin Fowler has been made during the development of the code.

It re-uses best-of breed packages such as SQLObject and Django, integrating
them with implemetations of other patterns within the framework's classes
(e.g. SessionView, DomainObjectManipulator, DomainMapper, DomainRegistry,
DomainObject, ApplicationBuilder, ModelBuilder, Plugin, Command, View) to form
a well-patterned, well-factored, unit-tested, codebase for new applications.

The DomainModel framework provides a highly object-oriented architecture for
enterprise applications, providing a multitude of flexible ways to override or
extend individual aspects. Because the framework is very open, it effectively
forms a toolbox of classes from which enterprise applications can be crafted.

The DomainModel framework emerged from work developing the KForge system:

The DomainModel framework is written in Python.
