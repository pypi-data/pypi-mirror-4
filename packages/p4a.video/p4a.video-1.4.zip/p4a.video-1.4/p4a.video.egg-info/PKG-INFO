        =========
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The *p4a.video* package provides a framework for handling video content on
        the Zope 2 and Zope 3 platforms.  It was inspired by the Plone ATVideo
        product and even borrows some UI.
        
        Project Description
        -------------------
        *p4a.video* allows you to:
        
        * convert a file object to a video
        * extract the video metadata
        * render an appropriate view (depending on the file format)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        *p4a.video* depends on the following packages:
        
        * p4a.subtyper
        * p4a.common
        * p4a.z2utils
        * p4a.fileimage
        * hachoir_core
        * hachoir_metadata
        * hachoir_parser
        
        If you use buildout, you can have it manage these dependencies by:
        
        * adding these lines to your buildout.cfg file
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            
            eggs = 
                ...
                p4a.video
            
            [instance]
            ...
            
            zcml = 
                ...
                p4a.video
        
        * re-run your buildout
        * Install the add-ons from the Add-on Products page in the
          Plone Control Panel
