        Release notes
        #############
        
        Version 0.4
        ***********
        
        Version 0.4 fixes many bugs and provides new features:
        
        * Pelix:
        
          * ``create_framework()`` utility method
          * The framework has been refactored, allowing more efficient services and
            events handling
        
        * iPOPO:
        
          * A component can provide multiple services
          * A service controller can be injected for each provided service, to
            activate or deactivate its registration
          * Dependency injection and service providing mechanisms have been refactored,
            using a basic handler concept.
        
        * Included tools:
        
          * Added a HTTP service component, using the concept of *servlet*
          * Added an extensible shell, interactive and remote, simplifying the usage
            of a framework instance
        
        Version 0.3
        ***********
        
        Packages have been renamed. As the project goes public, it may not have
