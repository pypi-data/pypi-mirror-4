{% autoescape off %}Hello {{ user.username }},

First of all, congratulations!  Your app is doing really well.

What this means for your Clutch account, however, is that you're past the
number of monthly active users allowed for your plan, and you'll need to
upgrade.

Don't panic, your users are still getting the latest version of your code, but
you won't be able to push any new updates or fixes to your users until you
upgrade.

Here's the link to upgrade: https://clutch.io/accounts/#plans

Cheers,
The Clutch.io Team{% endautoescape %}
