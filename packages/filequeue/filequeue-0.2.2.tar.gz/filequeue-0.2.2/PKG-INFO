Description: FileQueue is a thread-safe queue which is a subclass of Queue.Queue from the
        stdlib.
        
        FileQueue will overflow into a compressed file if the number of items
        exceeds maxsize, instead of blocking or raising Full like the regular Queue.
        
        The motivation came from wanting to queue a lot of work without consuming
        lots of memory.
