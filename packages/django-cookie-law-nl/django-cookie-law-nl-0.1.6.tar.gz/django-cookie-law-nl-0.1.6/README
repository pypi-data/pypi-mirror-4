Django cookie law
=================
This is a Django application that makes it easy to implement cookies compliant with Dutch law, as far as I am able
to tell. I'm not a lawyer, so use at your own risk.

Updating
--------

If you're updating from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5 take note that the CookieBar model has changed,
you should run the South migrations.

Requirements
------------

- jQuery

Usage
-----

- Add the cookie_law app to your INSTALLED_APPS.
- Add 'url(r'^cookies/', include('cookie_law.urls')),' to your main urls.py, without the ''.
- Run the cookie_law migrations or syncdb if you don't use South.
- Load the cookie_bar template tags and include {% show_cookie_bar %} under the <body> tag in your base template.
- Create a cookie bar in the admin (if you do not a default bar will be created, you should edit this asap).
- Surround your cookies with {% if request.COOKIES.allow_cookies == '1' %} <cookie> {% endif %}
