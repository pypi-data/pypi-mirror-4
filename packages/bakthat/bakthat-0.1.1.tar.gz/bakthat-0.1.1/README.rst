Bakthat
=======

Compress, encrypt (symmetric encryption) and upload files directly to Amazon S3 in a single command. Can also be used as a python module.

While navigating directories, I was tired of saying myself I should backup these #?!!* small files/directories.
Since I didn't found any solution that allows me to perform quickly encrypted backup on Amazon S3 from command-line, I wrote bakthat !

Here are some features:

* Hold everything in `StringIO <http://docs.python.org/library/stringio.html>`_ Objects
* Compress with `tarfile <http://docs.python.org/library/tarfile.html>`_
* Encrypt with `beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_
* Upload/download to S3 with `boto <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto>`_

You can restore backups **with** or **without** bakthat, you just have to download the backup, decrypt it with `Beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_ command-line tool and untar it.


Overview
========

::

    $ cd /dir/i/want/to/bak
    $ bakthat backup
    INFO: Backing up /dir/i/want/to/bak
    Password:
    $

    $ bakthat restore -f bak
    INFO: Restoring gene20120928.tgz.enc
    Password: 
    $

    $ bakthat ls
    INFO: S3 Bucket: bakthattest
    INFO: bak20120928.tgz.enc


Requirements
============

* `Aaargh <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/aaargh>`_
* `Pycrypto <https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/>`_
* `Beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_
* `Boto <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto>`_


Installation

You need to set your AWS credentials:

Usage
=====

Basic usage, "bakthat -h" or "bakthat <command> -h" to show the help.


Backup
------

::

    $ cd /dir/i/want/to/bak
    $ bakthat backup
    or
    $ bakthat backup -f /dir/i/want/to/bak

    you can also backup a single file
    $ bakthat backup -f /home/thomas/mysuperfile.txt


Restore
-------

You can restore the latest version of a backup just by specifying the begining of the filename.

::

    $ mo2s3 restore --f bak

    if you want to restore an older version
    $ mo2s3 restore --f bak20120927
    or
    $ mo2s3 restore --f bak20120927.tgz.enc


List
----

::

    $ bakthat ls


As a module
===========

::

    import bakthat
    aws_conf = {"access_key":"", "secret_key":"", "bucket": ""}

    bakthat.backup("/dir/i/wanto/bak", conf=aws_conf)

    # or if you want to have generated the configuration file with "bakthat configure"
    #Â and want to use this file:
    bakthat.backup("/dir/i/wanto/bak")

    # you can optionally pass a custom logger
    bakthat.backup("/dir/i/wanto/bak", logger=my_logger_instance, conf=aws_conf)

    # restore in the current working directory
    bakthat.restore("bak", logger=my_logger_instance, conf=aws_conf)
