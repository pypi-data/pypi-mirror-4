Description: Plone hotfix, 2012-11-06
        ========================
        
        This hotfix fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Plone,
        including arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.
        
        This hotfix should be applied to the following versions of Plone:
        
        # Plone 4.3 <= 4.3a2
        * Plone 4.2 <= 4.2.2
        * Any older version of Plone including 2.1, 2.5, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1
        
        The hotfix is officially supported by the Plone security team on the
        following versions of Plone in accordance with the Plone
        `version support policy`_: 3.3.6, 4.1.6, and 4.2.2. 
        However it has also received some testing on older versions of Plone.
        The fixes included here will be incorporated into subsequent releases of Plone,
        so Plone 4.2.3, 4.3b1 and greater should not require this hotfix.

        Q&A
        ===
        
        Q: How can I confirm that the hotfix is installed correctly and my site is protected?

          that look like this::

          The exact list of patches attempted depends on the version of Plone.
          If a patch is attempted but fails, it will be logged as a warning that says
          "Could not apply". This may indicate that you have a non-standard Plone
          installation.
        
        Q: How can I report problems installing the patch?
          A: Contact the Plone security team at security@plone.org, or visit the
          #plone channel on freenode IRC.
        
        Q: How can I report other potential security vulnerabilities?
          A: Please email the security team at security@plone.org rather than discussing
          potential security issues publicly.
        
        Q: I get a 'failed to LIST' error when accessing the root of my site via FTP.
          A: This is possibly because you are trying to use a Plone user to access the
          site root. You can continue to list the contents of the root as a root, Zope
          user, or set your initial directory to the ID of your Plone site.

        ----------------
        
         - Fix rare cases where allow_module patch was not successfully applied,
           depending on module import order. This affects security the security of
           RestrictedPython.
         
         - Add try/except for a Plone import in the getToolByName fix at the
           request of some CMF users. This corrects a log message in CMF sites
           and has no security implications.
        
         - Include the object name in the exception raised by getToolByName if
           a non-tool is found. This is for aiding debugging and has no security
           implications.
        
         - Allow the Factory Tool's Faux Archetype Tool to be returned by
           getToolByName. This fixes problems with creating content when combined with
           some custom code, it has no security implications.
        
         - Re-fixed FTP patch to allow publication of FTP listing method. This has no
           security implications.
