.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes a VPN connection. Use this if you want to delete a VPC and all its
associated components. Another reason to use this operation is if you believe
the tunnel credentials for your VPN connection have been compromised. In that
situation, you can delete the VPN connection and create a new one that has new
keys, without needing to delete the VPC or VPN gateway. If you create a new VPN
connection, you must reconfigure the customer gateway using the new
configuration information returned with the new VPN connection ID.
.sp
If you\(aqre deleting the VPC and all its associated parts, we recommend you detach
the VPN gateway from the VPC and delete the VPC before deleting the VPN
connection.
