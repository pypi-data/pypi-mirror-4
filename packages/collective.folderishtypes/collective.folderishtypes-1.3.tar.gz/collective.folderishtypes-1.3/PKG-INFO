Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Provides the types "Folderish Event", "Folderish News Item" and
        "Folderish Document" as replacements for their ATContentTypes equivalents.
        Those types are able to hold any other content, like a Folder.
        
        There is a "portlet" profile, which installs a portlet to show the contents of
        an folderish type.
        
        You can limit the types, which can be added to FolderishTypes by providing
        a Generic Setup import type configuration.
        
        The reason for this package is, that in my experience it's easier to group
        related content together at one place. An article about something fancy might
        have an image gallery associated with it as well as some pdf-downloads. With
        this package you can put everyting inside the article.
        Another use case is that you can structure content hierarchically and don't need
        to define "default pages" - a concept hard to understand and handle (see:
        http://www.sixfeetup.com/blog/plone-vs.-drupal-core-features-comparison )
        
        Alexander Limi also wished folderish content back in 2008:
        "#10: Content re-use is overrated â€” people like folderish"

        UPGRADE ISSUE WITH MISSING VIEWLET
        ==================================
        
        If you have any issues with collective.folderishtypes after a upgrade, it might
        come from the now missing collective.folderishtypes.folderish_listing_viewlet.
        For now, please remove it manually via @@manage-viewlets.
        
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        - Depend on z3c.jbot, so that overriding folder_listing and folder_summary_view
          might also work at IPloneSite root.
        - Write tests
        - if appropriate: remove portlet and recomment the use of 
          https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.portlet.localcontents/
