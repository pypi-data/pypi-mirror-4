get-identity-dkim-attributes
****************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the DNS records, or *tokens* , that must be present in order
for Easy DKIM to sign outgoing email messages.

This action takes a list of verified identities as input. It then
returns the following information for each identity:

* Whether Easy DKIM signing is enabled or disabled.

* The set of tokens that are required for Easy DKIM signing. These
  tokens must be published in the domain name's DNS records in order
  for DKIM verification to complete, and must remain published in
  order for Easy DKIM signing to operate correctly. (This information
  is only returned for domain name identities, not for email
  addresses.)

* Whether Amazon SES has successfully verified the DKIM tokens
  published in the domain name's DNS. (This information is only
  returned for domain name identities, not for email addresses.)

For more information about Easy DKIM signing, go to the Amazon SES
Developer Guide .
