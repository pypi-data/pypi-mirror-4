Various content types that are usable in the MegamanicEdit framework,
a contact type with endless options for emails, addresses and so on, a
contact landing page that can generate contacts based on an object
template, an Email message type for generating and sending out emails.

A lot of what used to be in GrailTact has now been moved to this
package.

Note on email messages: Home folders need to be enabled, and the email
message type has been specified to not use any workflow and set itself
to viewable only by the creator of the message and any user with the
Manager role.
