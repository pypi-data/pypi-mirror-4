        Overview
        =========
        
        SimpleHMMER is just that, a super simple way to run HMMER3 and parse the
        output. No biopython, no frills, just parse
        
        Installation
        =========
        
        Should be as simple as
        
            pip install SimpleHMMER
        
        Using MetaChecka2000
        =========
        
        Running hmmer
        
            from simplehmmer.simplehmmer import HMMERRunner
            HR=HMMERRunner(prefix='frode')
            HR.search('/path/to/some.hmm', '/path/to/some.fasta', '/path/to/save/to/')
            
        Parsing results
        
            from simplehmmer.simplehmmer import HMMERParser
            with open('/path/to/save/to/frode_out.txt', 'r') as fh:
                 HP = HMMERParser(fh)
                 while True:
                     result = HP.next()
                     if result:
                         print result
                     else:
                         break
        
        Super simple!
