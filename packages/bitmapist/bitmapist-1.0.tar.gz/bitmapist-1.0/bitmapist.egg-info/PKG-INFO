Description: bitmapist
        ---------------
        Implements a powerful analytics library using Redis bitmaps.
        
        This library makes it possible to implement real-time, highly scalable analytics that can answer following questions:
        
        * Has user 123 been online today? This week? This month?
        * Has user 123 performed action "X"?
        * How many users have been active have this month? This hour?
        * How many unique users have performed action "X" this week?
        * How many % of users that were active last week are still active?
        * How many % of users that were active last month are still active this month?
        
        This library is very easy to use and enables you to create your own reports easily.
        
        Using Redis bitmaps you can store events for millions of users in a very little amount of memory (megabytes).
        You should be careful about using huge ids (e.g. 2^32 or bigger) as this could require larger amounts of memory.

        Examples
        ---------------
        
        Setting things up::
        
            from datetime import datetime, timedelta
            from bitmapist import mark_event, MonthEvents
        
            now = datetime.utcnow()
            last_month = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=30)
        
        Mark user 123 as active::
        
            mark_event('active', 123)
        
        Answer if user 123 has been active this month::
        
            assert 123 in MonthEvents('active', now.year, now.month)
        
        How many users have been active this week?::
        
            print len(WeekEvents('active', now.year, now.isocalendar()[1]))
        
        Perform bit operations. Which users that have been active last month are still active this month?::
        
            active_2_months = BitOpAnd(
                MonthEvents('active', last_month.year, last_month.month),
                MonthEvents('active', now.year, now.month)
            )
        
        Nest bit operations!::
        
            active_2_months = BitOpAnd(
                BitOpAnd(
                    MonthEvents('active', last_month.year, last_month.month),
                    MonthEvents('active', now.year, now.month)
                ),
                MonthEvents('active', now.year, now.month)
            )
