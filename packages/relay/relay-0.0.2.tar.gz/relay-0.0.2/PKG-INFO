        ========
        
        Meta-magical SSH tunnels for remote developers behind firewalls.
        
        Currently allows for sharing SSH connections (for collaborating in tmux+vim) and for sharing local development webservers.
        
        Install
        --------
        
        Relay can be installed in a virtualenv, but we recommend installing it with sudo so it is always available::
        
            sudo pip install relay
        
        General setup
        -------------
        
        *(nprapps users see the next section)*
        
        Relay uses a configuration file located at `~/.relay.conf`. Create this file with contents such as::
        
            [relay]
            user = ubuntu
            server = relay_server.your_domain.com
            private_key = /path/to/your/private_key
            public_key = /path/to/your/public_key.pub
            pair_user = relay
            ports_json = /path/to/your/ports.json
        
        `ports.json` is a mapping of user's local ports to remote ports on the server, so that users will never collide when creating SSH tunnels. Create this file with contents such as::
        
            {
                "chris": {
                    "22": "2222",
                    "8000": "8000"
                },
                "katie": {
                    "22": "2223",
                    "8000": "8001"
                },
            }
        
        You then need to create a `relay` user. This process is automated::
        
            relay setup
        
        NPRApps setup
        -----------------
        
        Pre-baked configuration files are in our Dropbox folder. You must have Dropbox installed, syncing to `~/Dropbox` and the `nprapps` shared folder synced to your local computer. Then run::
        
            ln -s ~/Dropbox/nprapps/relay/relay.conf ~/.relay.conf
            relay setup
        
        Sharing SSH
        ------------------
        
        To share your SSH connection (for tmux'ing), open a new terminal (or tab or tmux pane)::
        
            relay user:$USER share:22
        
        Where `$USER` is your username in `ports.json`.
        
        To connect to a shared SSH connection::
        
            relay user:$USER ssh
        
        Where `$USER` is the username in `ports.json` of the user sharing the connection.
        
        Sharing development webserver
        -----------------------------
        
        To share your local development webserver, open a new terminal (or tab or tmux pane)::
        
            relay user:$USER share:8000
        
        Where `$USER` is your username in `ports.json`.
        
        To connect open a shared webserver in your browser::
        
            relay user:$USER web
        
        Where `$USER` is the username in `ports.json` of the user sharing the webserver.
