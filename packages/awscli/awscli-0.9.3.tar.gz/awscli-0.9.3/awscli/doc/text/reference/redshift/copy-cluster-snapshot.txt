copy-cluster-snapshot
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Copies the specified automated cluster snapshot to a new manual
cluster snapshot. The source must be an automated snapshot and it must
be in the available state.

When you delete a cluster, Amazon Redshift deletes any automated
snapshots of the cluster. Also, when the retention period of the
snapshot expires, Amazon Redshift automatically deletes it. If you
want to keep an automated snapshot for a longer period, you can make a
manual copy of the snapshot. Manual snapshots are retained until you
delete them.
