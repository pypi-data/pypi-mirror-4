Welcome to `xotl.ql` documentation!
===================================

The word "xotl" is a Nahuatl word that means foundation, base. The `xotl`
package comprises the foundation for building reliable systems: both
frameworks, libraries and an object model that allows to build complex systems.

This package `xotl.ql` implements a query language for python that is intended
to be used in `xotl` to express the semantics for retrieving objects. It's
distributed independently to allow other to use this language in their own
projects. It's expected that many pieces of `xotl` may be distributed this
way.
