Description: ======
        DQuery
        ======
        
        DQuery is a general tool used to extract metadata from a drupal multisite
        installation, and query this metadata using xpath. It also provides some other
        commands complementing drush. Inspired by drush and Gentoo linux equery.
        
        Planned features are an alternative package manager (to drush) and more
        complete integration against the Drupal version data API.
