0.4.0
=====
* added the following fields to the `api.Episode` class: `id`, `recap_url` and 
  `recap`
* switched from parsing the `Episode.summary` and `Show.summary` with a regexp 
  to BeautifulSoup which hopefully will be more stable than the regexp approach
* BeautifulSoup is now an external dependency (see requiremets.txt)
* added this file
