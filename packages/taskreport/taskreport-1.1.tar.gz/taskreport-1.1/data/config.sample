# select the tasks to include

# The order option indicates what keys should be used to order the tasks.
# The first key is used first, the plus or minus sign attached to it indicates
# whether the order should be increasing or decreasing. In cases of ties, the
# second key is used, and so on...

# "birthday" coming in the following month. The tasks are ordered first by
# decreasing priority, then the tasks sharing the same priority are ordered by
# decreasing due date.
