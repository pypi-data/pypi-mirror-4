"""
This is a simple example of building and running a simulation
using pypybox2d. Here we create a large ground box and a small dynamic 
circle.

NOTE:
There is no graphical output for this simple example, only text.

# such information as its density, friction, etc. The box(hx, hy) 
# parameter indicates for the polygon to be a box of half width
# 50 and half height 10. Since pypybox2d expects MKS units internally,
# the box is essentially 100m wide by 10m high. For a static body, this
# is just fine.

# is set, otherwise the fixture would become static.

# # Or attach a polygon:
# body.create_polygon_fixture(box=(1, 1), density=1.0, friction=0.3)

# As a test, apply an impulse either linearly or angularly:
#body.apply_angular_impulse(100.0)
#body.apply_linear_impulse((10.0, 0), (0, 0))

# This is our little game loop.

    # should know about this function. World also has an auto_clear_forces
    # option which will do this after every step for you.
