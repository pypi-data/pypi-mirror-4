Very Brief Notes for customizing CalendarX 0.9 branch
=====================================================

Go to the "manage" tab of your calendar instance, when logged in as admin.  Use
the various tabs to set the options for your calendar.  For example, when you
first start CalendarX it may not show the events because your workflow uses
different review states than what may be standard.  Click to the "manage" tab of
the CalendarX instance, use the dropdown to select the "Calendar options",
scroll down to the "List of review states to be displayed" option, and fill out
a list of review states, one per line, to reflect your Plone site.  Some
possibilities: 'published', 'pending', 'private', 'internal', 'external',
'internally_published', etc.

Read the other options to manage the look and feel and behavior of your
CalendarX instance.  Most of the configurations are the same as they were in the
0.6 branch documentation, it's just that you can find them here now instead of
in property sheets (nice change).

For more out of date but descriptive information about CalendarX, there is a PDF
document with details in the old 0.6.6 branch tarball and svn in the Collective
and at Sourceforge.  The material may be useful.  Also some of the older
CUSTOM.txt versions included this, but I've deleted them from this release.
