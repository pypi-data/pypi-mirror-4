Title: Lamson 0.9.1 Out, New Docs

I released Lamson 0.9.1 today so please "grab it and test it":/download.html and shoot me feedback.

The little changes are easier handling of attachments in MailRequest, a
small tweak to spam_filter, and then a bunch of test enhancements and extra
gear.  The big change is a redesign to lamson.args so that it infers the
command line arguments from the lamson.commands function keyword arguments.
It's mostly an internal change since others can't write their own commands
(yet).


h2. New Documentation

I ran into a bunch of folks who didn't know that Lamson had built-in spam
filtering, so I wrote a document on "Filtering Spam With
Lamson":http://lamsonproject.org/docs/filtering_spam.html that tells you how
to use it.

Lamson's spam filtering support is fairly simplistic, but still useful for
filtering crap out of your handlers.  It's biggest problem is the current
implementation requires you to use the (barely documented) "SpamBayes"
command line tools for things like training.

I've got some instructions to get you started with the most important
SpamBayes command line tool you'll need for training.


h2. ChangeLog

Here's the log of what I did:

* Big code review, cleanup, and test boosting.
* Modified the MailRequest.body so that it works with attachments.
* Updated the OSB in preparation for a redesign to make it more interesting.
* Didn't like the name 'attachments' for getting what's really all the parts of a message.
* Implemented a method on MailRequest to return all of the attachments in a message reliably.
* Setup the muttrc to use env to find the lamson command.
* Updated the commands and utils so that it works with the new lamson.args setup.
* Refactored lamson.args to use inspect to figure out the required defaults of a command function, thus removing the need for a...
* Contributed change to muttrc so it uses lamson wherever it is installed, even virtualenv.
