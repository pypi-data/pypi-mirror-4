0.3a13
------

- [bugfix] Fixed ``rattail.db.record_changes()`` so that it also ignores
  ``UserRole`` instance changes if configuration dictates that ``Role`` changes
  are to be ignored.

0.3a12
------

- [bugfix] Fixed foreign key uuid handling in ``rattail.db.record_changes()``.
  Some tables are meant to be used solely as providers of "association proxy"
  fields, the ``uuid`` column is not only a primary key, but also a *foreign
  key* to the "primary" entity table.  In such cases, the uuid value was not
  present at session flush time, so a new one was being generated.
  Unfortunately this meant that the ``Change`` record would point to a
  nonexistent entity record, so the sync would not work.  Now uuid fields are
  inspected to determine if a foreign key is present, in which case the
  relationship is traversed and the true uuid value is used.

- [feature] Added "extra classes" configuration for the ``load-host-data``
  command.  This is necessary when initially populating a "store" (er,
  "non-host") database instance if custom schema extensions are in use (and
  need to be synchronized with the host).
