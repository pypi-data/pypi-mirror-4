This is a small bit of Python code that wraps various Request objects
and returns a corresponding "Response". The responses, in this case,
come from saved files on disk rather than from actually loading the
web page.

The intended use of this module is in automated testing of scraping
code.

For now, it targets only "scrapy". It'd be great to have a version of
this that targeted "python-requests" as well.

Contributions are very welcome, and we use the bug tracker in the Github
project.
