Description: What is this?
        =============
        
        - This Plone product gives you a new popup_workflow so you can publish an item for pop-up effect. 
        - When clicking on it in the navigation menu or wherever the state class  is shown (like in folder_listing, tableview, )
        - The popup effect is disabled when logged in (so its possible to *edit content the normal way*)
        
        Warning: Version 4.1 is for Plone 4.1, 4.2 etc ONLY. Use version 0.7 for Plone 4.0
        
        
        How-to
        ==================
        - Install medialog.popupworkflow
        - Change workflow of a folder or content type or *something* to *Popup workflow*
        - *Change state* of some content to *Popup Publish*. For security reasons, the *change view* menu is now *disabled*. You will need to *Normal Publish* it to change view.
        - Log out, or use another browser
        - Click on that item in the navigation portlet
        
        If you uninstall the product, you should uninstall or reinstall collective.prettyphoto
