Description: 
        Construct is a library for parsing and building of data structures (binary or
        textual).
        
        It is based on the concept of defining data structures in a declarative manner,
        rather than procedural code: more complex constructs are composed of a hierarchy
        of simpler ones. It's the first library that makes parsing fun, instead of the
        usual headache it is today.
        
        Construct features bit and byte granularity, symmetrical operation (parsing
        and building), component-oriented design (declarative), easy debugging and
        testing, easy to extend (subclass constructs), and lots of primitive constructs
        to make your work easier (fields, structs, unions, repeaters, meta constructs,
        switches, on-demand parsing, pointers, etc.)
