Description: The Whirlpool hashing algorithm (http://www.larc.usp.br/~pbarreto/WhirlpoolPage.html),
        written by Vincent Rijmen and Paulo S. L. M. Barreto is a secure, modern hash which is
        as yet unbroken and fairly obscure. Provided on the algorithm's page is a C reference
        implementation which is fairly simple to wrap with a Python extension, which is much
        faster than re-implementation in pure Python.
