Description: A simple but flexible parser of SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA) model and decay files.
        
        pyslha is a parser/writer module for particle physics SUSY Les Houches Accord
        (SLHA) supersymmetric spectrum/decay files, and a collection of scripts which
        use the interface, e.g. for conversion to and from the legacy ISAWIG format, or
        to plot the mass spectrum and decay chains.
        
        The current release supports SLHA version 1, and as far as we're aware is also
        fully compatible with SLHA2: the block structures are read and accessed
        completely generically. If you have any problems with SLHA2, please provide an
        example input file and we'll investigate.
        
        The plotting script provides output in PDF, EPS and PNG via LaTeX and the TikZ
        graphics package, and as LaTeX/TikZ source for direct embedding into documents or
        user-tweaking of the generated output.
        
        TODOs:
         * Split writeSLHA into writeSLHA{Blocks,Decays}
         * Identify HERWIG decay matrix element to use in ISAWIG
         * Handle RPV SUSY in ISAWIG
