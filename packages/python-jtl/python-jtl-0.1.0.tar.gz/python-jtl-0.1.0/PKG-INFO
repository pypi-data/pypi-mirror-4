Description: ==========
        python-jtl
        ==========
        
        python-jtl provides a module called jtl which can be useful for parsing JMeter
        results (so called JTL files). JTL files can be either of XML or CSV (with or
        without the fieldnames) file format. jtl module supports both XML and CSV (with
        and without the fieldnames) file formats.
        
        The typical usage in general looks like this::
        
            from jtl import create_parser
        
            parser = create_parser('test_results.xml')
            for sample in parser.itersamples():
                ...

        * Supports both XML and CSV (with and without fieldnames) file formats;
        
        * Supports custom delimiter character (CSV only);
        
        * Stores results samples in named tuples;
