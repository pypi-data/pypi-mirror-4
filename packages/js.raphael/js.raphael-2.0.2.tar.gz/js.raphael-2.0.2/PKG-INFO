        ==========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `Raphael`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Raphael`: http://raphaeljs.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.raphael``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``raphael`` from ``js.raphael`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.raphael import raphael
          >>> raphael.need()
