Description: django-deployer
        ===============
        
        django-deployer is a deployment tool for Django that currently deploys any Django app to the following PaaS providers: 
        Dotcloud, Stackato and Google App Engine.
        
        The goal of django-deployer is to minimize the effort to deploy a Django app to any of the popular PaaS providers. It asks a series of questions about your Django project, and then generates a generic deploy.yml file that captures all of your project's requirements. django-deployer then uses this deploy.yml file to translate these requirements into specific configurations for each PaaS. 
        
        See the roadmap below for adding support for more providers: Heroku, OpenShift, Elastic Beanstalk and Gondor.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        To install django-deployer, use ``pip`` to fetch the package from PyPi:
        
        .. code:: bash
        	
            $ pip install django-deployer
        
        From your project's root directory:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ deployer-init
            $ fab setup
            ...
        
        Now inspect your project directory and you will see that a file ``deploy.yml`` and various config files were created. 
        
        **Note:** if you're going to try different PaaS providers, it's recommended that you make a separate git branch for each one, because when you re-run ``fab setup`` it could inadvertently overwrite the config files from the first run.
        
        Contribute
        ----------
        
        If you want to develop django-deployer, you can clone it and install it into your project's virtualenv:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ source bin/activate
            (venv)$ git clone git://github.com/natea/django-deployer.git
            (venv)$ cd django-deployer
            (venv)$ python setup.py develop
        
        Or you can also install an editable source version of it using pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ source bin/activate
            (venv)$ pip install -e git+git://github.com/natea/django-deployer.git#django-deployer
        
        Which will clone the git repo into the ``src`` directory of your project's virtualenv.
