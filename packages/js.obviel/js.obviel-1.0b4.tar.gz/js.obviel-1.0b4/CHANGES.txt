1.0b4 (2013-01-09)
==================

- Packaged Obviel 1.0b4.

- Improve dependencies for ``obviel``, ``obviel_template``, ``forms``,
  ``sync``.

- Add ``traject``, ``i18n``, ``forms_i18n`` resources.

- Improve sync dependencies, but not right yet: need to package jshashtable
  and jshashset first.

1.0b3 (2012-12-17)
==================

- Packaged Obviel 1.0b3

0.11.1 (2012-01-14)
===================

- Fix translation domain.

- My mistake, 0.11-1 did work. Ignore any previous evidence you ever saw of 0.11.1
  before now.

0.11-1 (2012-01-13)
===================

- Something in distutils/setuptools/distribute doesn't like the
  'resources' directory being symlinked, it just doesn't see it. As a
  result this never was in the 0.11 release. Try again hacking a real
  resources directory into existence temporarily for this release.

0.11 (2012-01-13)
=================

- Initial release.
