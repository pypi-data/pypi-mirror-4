Description: ************************************************************
        Python library to leverage SpazioDati's dataTXT with DBpedia
        ************************************************************
        
        `datatxt` is a library to query a dataTXT service and to enrich annotations
        with queries to DBpedia SPARQL endpoint. It will automatically
        convert literals to the corresponding Python types.
        
        Visit http://spaziodati.eu/dataTXT for documentation and
        examples.

        First you instantiate a dataTXT class::
        
            d = datatxt.Datatxt()
        
        Then you ask for annotation::
        
            result = d.annotation(text)
        
        You will receive a dictionary with annotation as DBpedia resources and for
        each resource you will receive all properties found in the DBpedia triplestore.
        
        The library will automatically convert typed literals to a coresponding
        simple type in Python. Dates are also converted if the dateutil_ library is
        available.
