Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This products provides a simple way to manage the search page based on
        portlets.
        
        For simplicity reasons and to avoid conflicts with existing themes, it
        does not override the default search page, but adds a new
        '@@multisearch' page.
        
        A link on this page allows to manage portlets displayed inside the page.

        ===========
        
        Work on collective.multisearch has been made possible by The Flemish
        Environment Agency or VMM. See http://www.vmm.be . VMM operates as an agency of
        the Flemish government for a better environment in Flanders. Flanders is one of
        the three Belgian regions with its own government, parliament and
        administration. The other two are the Brussels-Capital Region and the Walloon
        Region.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.0.1 (2013-03-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed our ManagePortletAssignments override.  It was meant for
          returning to the correct url (``@@manage-multisearch``) after
          changing a portlet, but it had an error so it did not work.  Also,
          it is not needed anymore after plone.app.portlets 2.4.3 is released.
