Description: CMSplugin Image Gallery
        ====================
        
        A Django application adding filer-based galleries to Django-CMS.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You need to install the following prerequisites in order to use this app::
        
            pip install Django
            pip install django-cms
            pip install django-filer
            pip install Pillow
        
        If you want to install the latest stable release from PyPi::
        
            $ pip install cmsplugin-image-gallery
        
        If you feel adventurous and want to install the latest commit from GitHub::
        
            $ pip install -e git://github.com/bitmazk/cmsplugin-image-gallery.git#egg=image_gallery
        
        Add ``image_gallery`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...,
                'image_gallery',
            )
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First create a gallery object with a filer folder.
        
        Create a CMS page with a placeholder and simply insert the plugin
        ``Filer Gallery``.
        
        You can also use our template tag to display a list of pictures::
        
            {% render_pictures %}
        
        ...for the last 3 uploaded pictures. You can use the selection parameters
        ``recent`` (default) and ``random`` and set an amount of pictures to display::
        
            {% render_pictures 'random' 10 %}
