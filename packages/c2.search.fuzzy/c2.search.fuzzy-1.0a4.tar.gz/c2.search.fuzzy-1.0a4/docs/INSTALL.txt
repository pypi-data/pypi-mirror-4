c2.search.fuzzy Installation
===================================

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``c2.search.fuzzy`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        c2.search.fuzzy

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        c2.search.fuzzy

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout -N

You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
