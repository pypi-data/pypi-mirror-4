create-lb-cookie-stickiness-policy
**********************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled
by the lifetime of the browser (user-agent) or a specified expiration
period. This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.

When a LoadBalancer implements this policy, the LoadBalancer uses a
special cookie to track the backend server instance for each request.
When the LoadBalancer receives a request, it first checks to see if
this cookie is present in the request. If so, the LoadBalancer sends
the request to the application server specified in the cookie. If not,
the LoadBalancer sends the request to a server that is chosen based on
the existing load balancing algorithm.

A cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests
from the same user to that server. The validity of the cookie is based
on the cookie expiration time, which is specified in the policy
configuration.
