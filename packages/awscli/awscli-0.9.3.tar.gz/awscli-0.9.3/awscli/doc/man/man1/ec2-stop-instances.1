.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Stops an instance that uses an Amazon EBS volume as its root device. Instances
that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and
started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you
are not billed for hourly instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon
EBS volume remains, continues to persist your data, and you are charged for
Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time.
.IP Note
Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be
restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM.
.sp
Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its
root device returns an error.
