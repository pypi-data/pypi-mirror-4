Bakthat
=======

Compress, encrypt (symmetric encryption) and upload files directly to Amazon S3/Glacier in a single command. Can also be used as a python module.

While navigating directories, I was tired of telling myself I should backup these #?!!* small files/directories.
Since I didn't found any solution that allows me to quickly perform encrypted backup on Amazon S3 from command-line, I wrote bakthat !

Here are some features:

* Compress with `tarfile <http://docs.python.org/library/tarfile.html>`_
* Encrypt with `beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_ (**optional**)
* Upload/download to S3 or Glacier with `boto <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto>`_
* Local Glacier inventory stored with `shelve <http://docs.python.org/library/shelve.html>`_
* Automatically handle/backup/restore a custom Glacier inventory to S3

You can restore backups **with** or **without** bakthat, you just have to download the backup, decrypt it with `Beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_ command-line tool and untar it.

Requirements
============

* `Aaargh <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/aaargh>`_
* `Pycrypto <https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/>`_
* `Beefish <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/beefish>`_
* `Boto <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/boto>`_


Installation
============

::

    $ pip install bakthat

You need to set your AWS credentials:

::

    $ bakthat configure


Usage
=====

Basic usage, "bakthat -h" or "bakthat <command> -h" to show the help.

S3 is the default destination, to use Glacier just add "-d glacier" or "--destination glacier".


Backup
------

::

    $ cd /dir/i/want/to/bak
    backup to S3
    $ bakthat backup
    or
    $ bakthat backup -f /dir/i/want/to/bak

    you can also backup a single file
    $ bakthat backup -f /home/thomas/mysuperfile.txt

    backup to Glacier
    $ bakthat backup -d glacier

Restore
-------

You can restore the latest version of a backup just by specifying the begining of the filename.

::

    $ mo2s3 restore -f bak

    if you want to restore an older version
    $ mo2s3 restore -f bak20120927
    or
    $ mo2s3 restore -f bak20120927.tgz.enc

    restore from Glacier
    $ mo2s3 restore -f bak -d glacier

When restoring from Glacier, the first time you call the restore command, the job is initiated, then you can check manually whether or not the job is completed (it takes 3-5h to complete), if so the file will be downloaded and restored.

List
----

::

    $ bakthat ls
    or 
    $ bakthat ls -d s3

    $ bakthat ls -d glacier


Delete
------

::

    $ bakthat delete -f bak

    $ bakthat delete -f bak -d glacier


Backup/Restore Glacier inventory
--------------------------------

Bakthat automatically backup the local Glacier inventory (a dict with filename => archive_id mapping) to your S3 bucket under the "bakthat_glacier_inventory" key.

You can trigger a backup mannualy:

::

    $ bakthat backup_glacier_inventory

And here is how to restore the glacier inventory from S3:

::

    $ bakthat restore_glacier_inventory


As a module
===========

::

    import bakthat
    aws_conf = {"access_key":"", "secret_key":"", "bucket": "", "vault": ""}

    bakthat.backup("/dir/i/wanto/bak", conf=aws_conf)
    bakthat.backup("/dir/i/wanto/bak", conf=aws_conf, destination="glacier")

    # or if you want to have generated the configuration file with "bakthat configure"
    #Â and want to use this file:
    bakthat.backup("/dir/i/wanto/bak")

    bakthat.ls()

    # restore in the current working directory
    bakthat.restore("bak", conf=aws_conf)
