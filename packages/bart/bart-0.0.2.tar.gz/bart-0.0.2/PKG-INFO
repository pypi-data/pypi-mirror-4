        *BART* is a set of code for modeling the light curves of exoplanet transits.
        
        The core light curve routines are written in Fortran and wrapped in Python.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        First, clone:
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/dfm/bart.git
            cd bart
        
        Next, set up your `virtual environment <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_:
        
        ::
        
            virtualenv venv --distribute
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Then, install the prerequisites (**note**: *on Mac OS, it's worth setting the
        environment variable* ``CC=clang``):
        
        ::
        
            pip install 'numpy>=1.6.2'
            pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        Finally, either build the Fortran and C extensions:
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py interface
            python setup.py build_ext --inplace
