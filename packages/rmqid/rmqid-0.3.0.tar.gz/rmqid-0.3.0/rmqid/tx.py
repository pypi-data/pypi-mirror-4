    The Tx class allows publish and ack operations to be batched into atomic
    units of work.  The intention is that all publish and ack requests issued
    within a transaction will complete successfully or none of them will.
    Servers SHOULD implement atomic transactions at least where all publish or
    ack requests affect a single queue.  Transactions that cover multiple
    queues may be non-atomic, given that queues can be created and destroyed
    asynchronously, and such events do not form part of any transaction.
    Further, the behaviour of transactions with respect to the immediate and
    mandatory flags on Basic.Publish methods is not defined.
