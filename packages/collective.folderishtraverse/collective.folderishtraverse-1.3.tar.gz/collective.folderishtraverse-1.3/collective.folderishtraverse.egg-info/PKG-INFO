Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package provides an view which traverses to the first item found in an
        ordered container. If the default view of the item, which the traverse view is
        traversing to is also a traverse view, the traversing happens again to the next
        sub-sub-item in the sub-folder, if possible.
        
        The traversing/redirection is only done for anonymous users. For logged in
        users, the folder contents view is shown. This way, members can easily edit the
        folder without beeing redirected to another folder.
        
        collective.folderishtraverse is an alternative to a default page in Plone. The
        difference is, that the target content is shown in the navigation tree and that
        traversing to any nested content in any level of the tree's hierarchy is
        possible.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.3 (2012-11-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Show the Actions and Display content-menus also in folder listings. Allows
          Action submenu items like from c.folderorder and setting the display to
          something else than traverse_view.
          [thet]
        
        - Add statusmessage for when displaying the traverse_view for non-anonymous
          users.
          [thet]
        
        - When no endpoint is found, redirect to folder_summary_view for anonymous
          users. folder_contents needs higher permissions.
          [thet]
        
        1.2 (2012-11-07)
        ----------------
        
        - For non-anonymous users or if no endpoint was found, redirect to
          folder_contents. This view is generally nicer and more usable.
          [thet]
        
        1.1 (2012-02-20)
