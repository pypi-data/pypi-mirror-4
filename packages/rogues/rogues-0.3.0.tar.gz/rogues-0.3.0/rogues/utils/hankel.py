    hankel(a) returns a toeplitz matrix given "a", the first row of the
    matrix.  This matrix is defined as:

         [[   a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3], ..., a[n-1], a[n] ]]
          [   a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4], ...,   a[n],   0  ]

          [   a[n],    0,      0,  0,   ...           0 ] ]


    Note that all the non-zero anti-diagonals are constant

    If called as hankel(a, b) then create the hankel matrix where a is the
    first column and b is the last row.  If a[-1] != b[0], a[-1] is chosen
    but a warning message is printed.  For example

    Warning: a[-1] != b[0]. a[-1] is chosen
