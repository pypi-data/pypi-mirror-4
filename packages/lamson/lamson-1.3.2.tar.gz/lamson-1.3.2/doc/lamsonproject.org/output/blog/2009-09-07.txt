Title: Lamson 1.0pre5 Out

I just pushed Lamson 1.0pre5 to PyPI for your enjoyment:

"PyPI Download":http://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=files&name=lamson&version=1.0pre5

You can also get it from "releases":/releases/ or by doing the usual
easy_install.

This is a small bugfix release that only adds one small feature.  If
you're running with the SMTPReceiver, you can raise a server.SMTPError with
an error code you want and the SMTPReceiver will return that as the error
code to the client.

For example, if you do this in your handler:

<pre class="code prettyprint">
@route(".+")
def START(message):
    raise server.SMTPError(550)
</pre>

Then it will generate a reasonable error message (using lamson.bounce
messages) and give that to the client.  You can also give a second
parameter to SMTPError that will be the error message if you don't
like the automatic ones.

Only warning with this is use it sparingly, as it then ties you always
running Lamson as an SMTPReceiver, instead of off the QueueReceiver.  It also
leaks out to malicious clients more information about your server than
you might want them to know.  In general, it's better to just ignore bad
messages and save them in an undeliverable queue for later inspection.

Alright, try it out and report bugs to me.  Thanks.
