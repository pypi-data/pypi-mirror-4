appypi: sandboxing apps from Pypi packages
==========================================
**appypi** is a terminal-based
[Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi) package manager.
Each app installed through appypi is sandboxed in an individual virtualenv
and usable from the user space. No root access is required to install an app.
appypi in **NOT** a replacement for [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/)
or [easy_install](http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall).
Actually, it uses pip intensively to manage package installations.

appypi creates launchers into the user ~/bin directory. These launchers mimic
the package behavior in terms of what commands can be called. For example,
appypi will create a *django-admin.py* launcher when installing the
[django](http://djangoproject.com/) package, and a *fab* launcher
when installing the [Fabric](http://fabfile.org/) package.
This way, you can use the package as if it was installed with pip directly.

appypi won't install a package if it finds it in your path already.
It is your duty to take care of these external installations before using appypi.


Installing a package:

    $ appypi install django
    Looking for django...
    Found Django version 1.4.2
    Installing...
    Install successful!

Upgrading a package:

    $ appypi upgrade django
    Upgrading: Django (1.3 => 1.4.2)

Removing a package:

    $ appypi remove django
    These packages will be REMOVED:

        Django

    Do you want to continue? [y/n]y
    Package Django has been removed.
