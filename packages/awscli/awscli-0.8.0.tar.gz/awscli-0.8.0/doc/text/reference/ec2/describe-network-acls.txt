describe-network-acls
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about the network ACLs in your VPC. You can
filter the results to return information only about ACLs that match
criteria you specify. For example, you could get information only the
ACL associated with a particular subnet. The ACL must match at least
one of the specified values for it to be included in the results.

You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the ACL is associated with a
particular subnet and has an egress entry that denies traffic to a
particular port). The result includes information for a particular ACL
only if it matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
message is returned; the response is simply empty.

You can use wildcards with the filter values: an asterisk matches zero
or more characters, and "?" matches exactly one character. You can
escape special characters using a backslash before the character. For
example, a value of "\*amazon\?\\" searches for the literal string
"*amazon?\" .

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for Network ACLs. For a
   complete reference to the available filter keys for this operation,

         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an

         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
