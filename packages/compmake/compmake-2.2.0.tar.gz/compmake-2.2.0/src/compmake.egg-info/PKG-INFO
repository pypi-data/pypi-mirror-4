Description: **Compmake** is a non-obtrusive module that provides:
        
        * ``make``--like facilities to your Python computations
          (``make``, ``clean``, etc.), including caching of temporary
          results (that is, you can interrupt your program, and
          restart it without losing (much) data.) 
        
        * A console for inspecting failures and partial completion. 
        
        * Single-host (using the ``multiprocessing`` module) and
          multiple-host parallelization (using ssh-spawned slaves). 
          
        * Peace of mind!
        
        See <http://compmake.org> for documentation.
