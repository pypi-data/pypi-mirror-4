           about the purpose of the option, the format and semantics of the

        =============
        
        .. Note to recipe author!
           ----------------------
           zc.buildout provides a nice testing environment which makes it
           relatively easy to write doctests that both demonstrate the use of
           the recipe and test it.
           You can find examples of recipe doctests from the PyPI, e.g.
           
             http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg
        
           The PyPI page for zc.buildout contains documentation about the test
           environment.
        
             http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout#testing-support
        
           Below is a skeleton doctest that you can start with when building
           your own tests.
        
        We'll start by creating a buildout that uses the recipe::
        
            >>> write('buildout.cfg',
            ... """
            ... [buildout]
            ... parts = test1
            ...
            ... [test1]
            ... recipe = gp.recipe.node
            ... npms = coffee-script less
            ... scripts = coffee lessc
            ... """)
        
        Running the buildout gives us::
        
            >>> print 'start', system(buildout) 
            start...
            Installing test1.
            ...
            Generated script '.../bin/lessc'.
