        ====================================
        
        Pounce is a simple downloader written in Python.  It can be run from the command line where it presents
        a menu to the user, guiding them through a simple process in order to get online resources, or it can be
        provided with command line arguments, foregoing the walkthrough.
        
        Example usage (CLI with args):
        ------------------------------
        
        Simple single file downloading:
        
        ./pounce.py -u http://www.pathtoresource.com/resource.file -o /path/to/save/in/
        
        Download links contained in a text file:
        
        ./pounce.py -f /file/containing/links.txt -o /save/files/here/
