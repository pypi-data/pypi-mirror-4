        ``kahgean.logkit`` makes configuring log handlers become easy.
        
        ``kahgean.daemonize`` can help developers to write daemon programs.
        
        ``kahgean.initial`` provides some functions that should be invoked
        as soon as possible before doing any meaningful processing.

        addresses and/or subnetworks.
