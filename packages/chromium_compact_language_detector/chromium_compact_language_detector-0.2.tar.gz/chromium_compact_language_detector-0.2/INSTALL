Installation Instructions
*************************

Build this python binding in a single command using a typical setup.py:
$ ./setup.py install

NOTE: if this step fails saying that pkg-config cannot find cld on
your system (and you're certain you did install it), you may have to
set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH manually, eg (exact syntax depends on shell):

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

(If /usr/local/lib is where cld was installed).  And then re-run
./setup.py install.

----
Before installing, you might want to test compilation with:
$ ./setup.py build
$ ./setup.py test
If the test fails, there must be a problem with your library. I would suggest you to report us a bug.

All typical options of a Python setup are available. For details, check:
$ ./setup.py install --help

For instance to install in your locale prefix, if this one is /home/me/.local/:
$ ./setup.py install --prefix=/home/me/.local/

This way, if you use (for instance Python 2.6), the library will be installed in: /home/me/.local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/cld.so
