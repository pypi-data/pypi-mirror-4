= LEAP CLient Release Checklist (*) =

Not that we are following all steps here, but it is good to keep some
sort of sanity...

  * [X] validate rc
    * [X] all rc-critical closed!
    * [X] all bbots green
    * [X] uploaded translations: make translations
    * [X] re-generate pyqt resources
    
  * [O] update docs
    * [X] check installation sections
    * [ ] CREDITS
    * [X] relnotes.txt
    * [X] docs/known_issues.rst
    * [X] NEWS.rst: Add release name and date to top-most item in NEWS.

  * [X] change docs/install.rst to point to just the current
    leap-client-X.Y.Z.deb binaries and .tar.gz source code files
  * [X] on release/vX.Y.Z branch: git pull
  * [ ] git tag X.Y.Z
  * [ ] build locally to make sure the release is reporting itself as the
    intended version ...
  * [ ] make sure buildbot is green
  * [ ] make sure other people aren't committing at that moment
  * [ ] FUTURE: push tag along with some other documentation-only patch (typically to
    relnotes.txt) to trigger buildslaves
    * [ ] git push --tags leap; git push leap
    * [ ] that will build tarballs

  * [ ] download tarballs, sign with "gpg -ba -u deadbeef TAR", upload *.asc
  * [ ] symlink the release tarball on leap.se downloads page:
    /var/www/source/leap-client/releases/ CHANGEME XXX
    
  * [X] update news pages. release notes.
  * [ ] send out relnotes.txt to internal list.

  * [ ] wait ...?
