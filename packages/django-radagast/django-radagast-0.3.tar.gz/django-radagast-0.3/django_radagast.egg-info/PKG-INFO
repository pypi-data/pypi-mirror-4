        ===========================
        
        Radagast: the wizard no-one has heard of.
        
        A wizard that is similar to the one in Django except that:
        
        * It uses jinja2 and jingo.
        * It will work with or without Ajax.
        * The path it takes can change.
        * You don't need to have a form on every page.
        * It does a lot less.
        * It lets you work with views in the normal way, if that's what you want.
        * You can set URL paths to specific parts of the wizard.
