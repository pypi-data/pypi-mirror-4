Where to get |masai| 
=====================

To get a working installation of |masai|, on any platform (windows, mac OS X, Linux ... ), 
three solutions are (or will be soon) available.

* installation from a binary executable

* installation from downloaded zip/tar source file

* by cloning or (creating a fork for the developpers) of the Github |masai| repository 
   

From binaries
**************

Not yet available, but in preparation

From downloaded sources
************************

Downloads zip/tar archives working for all platforms are available.
You can use the following links after having read the License information 
(`LICENSE (en) <_static/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html>`_ 
or `LICENCE (fr) <_static/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-fr.html>`_)

* `tar archives <https://github.com/fernandezc/masai/tarball/master>`_

* `zip archives <https://github.com/fernandezc/masai/zipball/master>`_

Clone or fork of the Github repository
***************************************
Alternatively, you can make a clone/fork of the github sources at: 

* `https://github.com/fernandezc/masai  <https://github.com/fernandezc/masai>`_

This is the recommended solution for developpers 
and those who would like to contribute


Requirements
=============

|masai| requires a working python installation. 

* `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ 

and a fortran90 compiler. If you do not have this on your computer, 
you can use for instance:

* `gfortran <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_

Currently, only the python 2.7 version has been tested. It should work with
previous version of python, and (although not checked) should not worked with 
python 3.0.

The following libraries are also required:

* `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ 
    
* `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
    
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/index.html>`_

* `Traits <http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/>`_
    
* `Pyface <http://code.enthought.com/projects/pyface/>`_
        
Follow the instructions to install these packages on those sites, or, far easier, 
install them as packages from your operating system 
(e.g. apt-get or the synaptic GUI on Ubuntu, `Macports <http://www.macports.org/>`_ on OS X, etc.).

Regarding the installation of all these above packages, we highy recommend to install EPD python framework (a much straitforward solution!) 
which is available for most platforms:

* `Enthougth Python Distribution (EPD) <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ 

Installation
=============

After installing the above dependencies download the tar/zip source 
distribution.

.. tip::

	On most UNIX-like systems, youâ€™ll probably need to run these commands as root or using sudo.


Ungzip and untar the source package, cd to the new directory, and execute::

	$ python setup.py install

or ::

	$ python setup.py develop 
	
to install it in the developper mode.

Check the installation
=======================

If the |masai| was properly installed, you should get the following import 
working correctly in a terminal python session or better in IPython console.

Run a IPython session by issuing in the terminal the following command::

	$ ipython
	
Then execute two commands as following:
	
.. sourcecode:: ipython

    In [1]: from masai.api import Source
    
    In [2]: fd = Source()
    
where the second commands should open a dialog to set the current dataset source.

If this goes well, the |masai| application is properly installed.
