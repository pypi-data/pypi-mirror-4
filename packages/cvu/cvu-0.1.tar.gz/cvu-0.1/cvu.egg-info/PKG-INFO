        ==COPYRIGHT INFORMATION==
        This program strictly observes the tenets of fundamentalist Theravada Mahasi 
        style Buddhism.  Any use of this program in violation of these aforementioned 
        tenets or in violation of the principles described in the Visuddhimagga Sutta is
        strictly prohibited and punishable by extensive Mahayana style practice.

        ==PACKAGES USED==
        ===required packages===
        MNE Python -- used for extracting and displaying surfaces from freesurfer
        	annotations, and for circle-plot visualizations
        matplotlib -- plotting library (included in EPD)
        traits/traitsui -- traits object framework (included in EPD)
        chaco -- interactive plotting library (included in EPD)
        mayavi/mlab/tvtk -- interactive 3D visualization library (included in EPD)
        getopt -- module to process command line arguments
        numpy/scipy -- math library for python (included in EPD)
        
        ===optional packages===
        METIS -- graph partitioning library
        METIS (python) -- a python library wrapping METIS
        networkx -- a graph theory module for python (included in EPD)
        graph-tool -- a graph theory module for python.  Not integrated as of now.
        
        (If METIS and networkx are not installed the --use-metis flag will result in
        	errors when attempting to calculate modules.  These errors are not fatal
        	but the --use-metis builtin modularity analysis will not work.
        	--use-spectral will still work.)
