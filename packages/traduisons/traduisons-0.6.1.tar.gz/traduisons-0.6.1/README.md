Traduisons!
===========
![Traduisons Logo](https://traduisons.googlecode.com/files/traduisons.png)

Traduisons! (French for "Let's Translate!") is a front-end for various online
translation services, allowing translation of words and sentences without opening
the browser. It is written in python and optionally uses a gtk-based gui.

Traduisons! is focused on being as streamlined and fast as possible. It is
designed to be a quick, reference tool, not a large-scale document
translator.

Traduisons! itself is not a translator. It works by sending a query string
to a web-based translation service and copying the result to the
clipboard and screen.

All operations are performed with keyboard shortcuts or specific input
characters such as '`/`' and '`.`'.

Internet access is required to use Traduisons!.
