associate-address
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The associate-address operation associates an elastic IP address with
an instance.

If the IP address is currently assigned to another instance, the IP
address is assigned to the new instance. This is an idempotent
operation. If you enter it more than once, Amazon EC2 does not return
an error.
