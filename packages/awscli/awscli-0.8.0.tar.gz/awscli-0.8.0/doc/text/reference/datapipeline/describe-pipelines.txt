describe-pipelines
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Retrieve metadata about one or more pipelines. The information
retrieved includes the name of the pipeline, the pipeline identifier,
its current state, and the user account that owns the pipeline. Using
account credentials, you can retrieve metadata about pipelines that
you or your IAM users have created. If you are using an IAM user
account, you can retrieve metadata about only those pipelines you have
read permission for.

To retrieve the full pipeline definition instead of metadata about the
pipeline, call the  get-pipeline-definition action.
