.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBassume\-role\fP action returns a set of temporary security credentials that
you can use to access resources that are defined in the role\(aqs policy. The
returned credentials consist of an Access Key ID, a Secret Access Key, and a
security token.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Only IAM users can assume a role. If you use AWS account
credentials to call AssumeRole, access is denied.
.sp
The credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling
\fBassume\-role\fP , which can be from 15 minutes to 1 hour.
.sp
When you assume a role, you have the privileges that are defined in the role.
You can further restrict the privileges by passing a policy when calling
\fBassume\-role\fP .
.sp
To assume a role, you must be an IAM user from a trusted entity and have
permission to call \fBassume\-role\fP . Trusted entites are defined when the IAM
role is created. Permission to call \fBassume\-role\fP is defined in your or your
group\(aqs IAM policy.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-role\-arn\fP  (string)
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assuming.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-role\-session\-name\fP  (string)
An identifier for the assumed role session. The session name is included as
part of the \fBAssumedRoleUser\fP .
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-policy\fP  (string)
A supplemental policy that can be associated with the temporary security
credentials. The caller can restrict the permissions that are available on the
role\(aqs temporary security credentials to maintain the least amount of
privileges. When a service call is made with the temporary security
credentials, both the role\(aqs permission policy and supplemental policy are
checked. For more information about how permissions work in the context of
temporary credentials, see \fIControlling Permissions in Temporary Credentials <
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/TokenPermissions.html>\fP
_ .
.TP
.B \fB\-\-duration\-seconds\fP  (integer)
The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value can range from 900
seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour). By default, the value is set to
3600 seconds (1 hour).
.TP
.B \fB\-\-external\-id\fP  (string)
A unique identifier that is generated by a third party for each of their
customers. For each role that the third party can assume, they should instruct
their customers to create a role with the external ID that was generated by
the third party. Each time the third party assumes the role, they must pass
the customer\(aqs correct external ID. The external ID is useful in order to help
third parties bind a role to the customer who created it. For more information
about the external ID, see \fI\%About the External ID\fP in \fIUsing
Temporary Security Credentials\fP .
