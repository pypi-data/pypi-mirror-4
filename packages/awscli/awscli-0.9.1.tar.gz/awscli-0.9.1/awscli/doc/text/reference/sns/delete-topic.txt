delete-topic
************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The delete-topic action deletes a topic and all its subscriptions.
Deleting a topic might prevent some messages previously sent to the
topic from being delivered to subscribers. This action is idempotent,
so deleting a topic that does not exist will not result in an error.

     --topic-arn <value>
