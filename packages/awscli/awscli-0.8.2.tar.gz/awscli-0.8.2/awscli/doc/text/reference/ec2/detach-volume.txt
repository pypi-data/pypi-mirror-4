*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Detach a previously attached volume from a running instance.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws ec2 detach-volume
     --volume-id <value>
     [--instance-id <value>]
     [--device <value>]
     [--force ]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--volume-id"  (string)
   The ID of the volume to detach.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--instance-id"  (string)
   The ID of the instance from which to detach the the specified
   volume.

"--device"  (string)
   The device name to which the volume is attached on the specified
   instance.

"--force"  (boolean)
   Forces detachment if the previous detachment attempt did not occur
   cleanly (logging into an instance, unmounting the volume, and
   detaching normally).

   This option can lead to data loss or a corrupted file system. Use
   this option only as a last resort to detach a volume from a failed
   instance. The instance will not have an opportunity to flush file
   system caches nor file system meta data. If you use this option,
   you must perform file system check and repair procedures.
