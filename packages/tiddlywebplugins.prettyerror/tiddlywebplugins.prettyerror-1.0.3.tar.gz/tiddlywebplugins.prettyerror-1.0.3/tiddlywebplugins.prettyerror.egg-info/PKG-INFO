Description: A plugin for TiddlyWeb that provides prettier error messages
        than the plain text straight exceptions provided by the 
        TiddlyWeb core.
        
        The content is provided by tiddlers containing templated HTML.
        
        The tiddlers are provided via a recipe called errors made up of
        two bags. One contains the default error pages, the other is
        initially empty such that the ADMIN of the instance can do what
        they like.
        
        This software was developed for use with TiddlySpace. It should
        be noted that using it can have a tendency to make logged error
        messages more confusing than they might otherwise be.
        
        See tiddlywebplugins.pretterror.exceptor for details.
