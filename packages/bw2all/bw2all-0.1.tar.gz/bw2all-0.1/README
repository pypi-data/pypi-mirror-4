=========================================
Install the complete Brightway2 framework
=========================================

This is a wrapper for the separate packages that make up the Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework. It installs all Brightway2 components and their dependencies:

* brightway2
* bw2calc
* bw2ui
* bw2analyzer
* progressbar
* flask
* nose
* docopt
* voluptuous

SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib will also bw installed, but because they can be difficult to install correctly, it is recommended to install them using a prepackaged distribution like Python (x,y) or a package manager like macpors (Mac OS X) or apt (Debian/Ubuntu). See the Brightway2 documentation for more details. If you want to program with or use the more advanced features of Brightway2, then you should use the advanced installation.
