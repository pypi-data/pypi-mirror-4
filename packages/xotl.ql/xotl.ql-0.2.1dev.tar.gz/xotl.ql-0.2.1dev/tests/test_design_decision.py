    '''Tests that toy.type == 'laptop' does not get singled out of its
    containing expression.

    The following procedure is not current any more; but we leave it
    there for historical reasons. Since the introduction of "particle
    bubble" that captures all the parts and tokens, we have removed
    the :attr:`xotl.ql.interfaces.IQueryPart.tokens`.

       Slight variation over the same test of previous testcase but
       that shows how `|` that if we don't have the `tokens` params
       things will go wrong:

       - `parent.age > 32` will have `this('parent')` as its token

       - `child.age < 5` will have `this('parent').children` as its
         token.

       - When building `(parent.age > 32) & (child.age < 5)` the
         resultant part will have only `this('parent')` as the token,
         and

       - `contains(child.toys, 'laptop')` will be attached to
         `this('parent').children`, but this will create a stack in the
         token for `child`, the stack will contain: ``child.age < 5``,
         and ``contains(child.toys, 'laptop')``, for they don't merge.

       - Then, building ``... | contains(child.toys, 'laptop')`` will
         be attached to `this('parent')` only! This will cause that the
         token `this('parent').children` will be left with a stack of
         two items that will be considered separate filters, which is
         wrong!

       The solutions seems to be simply to make
       `this('parent').children` aware of parts that are generated. So
       :attr:`xotl.ql.core.QuerPart.tokens` is born.
