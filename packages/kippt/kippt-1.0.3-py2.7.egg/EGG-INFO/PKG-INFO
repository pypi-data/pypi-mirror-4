Description: Python Wrapper for Kippt
        
        This is a Python wrapper for Kippt's API (https://kippt.com/developers). It has all of the features of the C# library (http://haythem.github.com/Kippt.NET/), plus some extras.
        
        Documentation
        
        The file is heavily commented on documentation - so just take a look if you need any further clarification. I tried to keep as close to the C# library as possible.
