Description: This package implements a git export command that can be given a list of
        already exported worktrees and the tree SHAs these worktrees correspond
        too. For every file to export it then looks in the existing worktrees whether
        an identical file is already present and in that case hardlinks to the new
        export location instead of writing the same file again.
        
        Use Case: A git based web deployment system that exports git trees to be
        served by a web server. Every new deployment is written to a new folder. After
        the export, the web server should start serving new requests from the new
        folder.
        
        Be aware of the dangers of hardlinks. Hardlinks on linux do not
        have copy-on-write semantics! This command also does not verify the integrity
        of old exported trees. Use git reset --hard after this command to guarantee
        a correct export.
