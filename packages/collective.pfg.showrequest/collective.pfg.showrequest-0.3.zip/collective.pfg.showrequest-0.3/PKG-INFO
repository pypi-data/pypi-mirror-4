Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.pfg.showrequest shows field labels and values on the next form generated by PloneFormGen.
        
        Currently tested with
        ---------------------
        
        * Plone-4.2.1
        * Products.PloneFormGen-1.7.2
        
        Sometimes, you might need to chain forms to create wizard like forms where
        you want to show field input results from the previous form.
        This package serves for this need by simply registering viewlet to plone.app.layout.viewlets.interfaces.IAboveContentBody interface.
        
        How To
        ------
        Once you have quickinstalled collective.pfg.showrequest,
        go to the Form Folder (*Form2*) where you want to show the field results.
        
        There is **Show Request** button under Actions, so click it.
        Input field ids from the previous form (*Form1*) and save it.
        
        * The order will effect the resulting order.
        
        Copy the field types from the *Form1* to the *Form2* with default values and overrides empty.
        
        * To show the field result correctly, you need to have the same field in both Form1 and Form2 for the showing fields.
        
        You will see previous form results above the content body now like it is
        on thanks page.
