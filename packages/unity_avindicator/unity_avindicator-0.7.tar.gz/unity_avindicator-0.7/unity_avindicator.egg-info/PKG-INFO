Description: Web/Microphone muting application
        -------------------
        
        This application was created as I was annoyed that there was not a Unity app 
        that I could use to quickly check my webcam and microphone status.
        
        It assumes a couple things:
         * Gtk2 and its python bindings are installed and available.
         * the requirements.txt file is installed
         * this uses the amixer command so if its not available for your system, too bad.
         * It assumes that you have a uvcvideo USB webcam.
        
        Before this will work you will need to add the following line to your sudoers file:
        
        Example:
            raptorx  ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/modprobe uvcvideo
        
        If you want this to load on login add an entry in Ubuntu's StartupApplications.
        
        If you have an application that is currently using the webcam it will not
        work until the application is closed.
        
        This was originally created and tested on and for a Gazelle System76 laptop.
        
        The included tests will determine if the toggling of the webcam and microphone work.
        
        Once installed to run the application manually type: avindicator
