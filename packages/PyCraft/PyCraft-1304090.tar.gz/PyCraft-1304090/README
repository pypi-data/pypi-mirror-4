PyCraft is a high quality Minecraft world editor in Python. Even though main
objective of this package is to be Python 3.x compliant, it is written to ease
backward portability with Python 2.7 language specifications.

Minecraft is a multiplayer sandbox game. More information can be found at
their official site: http://www.minecraft.net

Currently, PyCraft only allows *offline* world editing.
