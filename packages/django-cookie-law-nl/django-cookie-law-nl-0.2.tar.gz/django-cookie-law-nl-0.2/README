Django cookie law
=================
This is a Django application that makes it easy to implement cookies compliant with Dutch law, as far as I am able
to tell. I'm not a lawyer, so use at your own risk.

Updating
========

From 0.1.6 to 0.2
-------------------

The model has changed, run South migrations. Multilingual support has been added. Optional title and close fields
added.


From 0.1.4 to 0.1.5
--------------------

If you're updating from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5 take note that the CookieBar model has changed,
you should run the South migrations.


Requirements
============

- jQuery

Usage
=====

- Add the cookie_law app to your INSTALLED_APPS.
- Add 'url(r'^cookies/', include('cookie_law.urls')),' to your main urls.py, without the ''.
- Run the cookie_law migrations or syncdb if you don't use South, but you should.
- Load the cookie_bar template tags and include {% show_cookie_bar %} under the <body> tag in your base template.
- Create a cookie bar in the admin (if you do not a default bar will be created, you should edit this asap).
- Surround your cookies with {% if request.COOKIES.allow_cookies == '1' %} <cookie> {% endif %}


Cookie Bar Details
------------------

- Optional title:
    This title can be displayed as a title for your text
- Optional link cookie policy page:
    If you want a page explaining what kind of cookies you use and why place the full url here.
- Optional display name of the link:
    This will be displayed after the display text. For instance:
    "This site uses cookies, read about it <link_display_name>"
- Title of the allow cookie button:
    This will be the text shown in the cookie bar button.
- Text:
    The text displayed in the cookie bar.
- "This cookie bar is displayed":
    Check this if you want this particular cookie bar to be shown.
    Cookie bars without this boolean will not be shown.
- Optional "Show a close (dismiss) button for this cookie bar" boolean:
    The close field is used when you want to give visitors the option to hide the cookie bar
    while not accepting cookies. This is turned off by default.
- Optional Language:
    You can create a cookie bar for multiple languages, read more about this in the Multilingual support section.
    Each of these cookie bars will need the "This cookie bar is displayed" boolean set to True.


Multilingual Support
--------------------

If you want multilingual support add the languages you want to your settings file.
LANGUAGES = (('nl','Nederlands'), ('en','English'))
Every time the cookie bar template tag is called it will check if a cookie bar exists for each language,
if not; one will be created. It is up to you to translate these into the right language.
You can do this via the admin.

The multilingual support works by checking for a LANGUAGE_CODE in the request.
Localization middleware should handle this. If this doesn't exist the default Dutch cookie bar will be used.
