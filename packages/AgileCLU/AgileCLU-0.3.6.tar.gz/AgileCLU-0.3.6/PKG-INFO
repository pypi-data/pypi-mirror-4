Description: AgileCLU
        ========
        This library and script package is an implementation of command line tools and Python module 
        that can be used to write software against Limelight Networks' Agile Storage cloud platform.
        It leverages Agile Storage's JSON-RPC APIs to manage, ingest and egress objects from the 
        Agile Cloud.
        
        Communication
        -------------

        Installation
        ------------
        You do not need to download the source code to install AgileCLU.  You can install this from PyPI with one of the following commands (sudo is usually required):
        
        	easy_install AgileCLU
        
        or,
        
        	pip install AgileCLU
        
        If you don't have PyPI installed and you are running on Ubuntu or Debian, install it first.
        
        	sudo apt-get install python-pip
        
        Upgrading
        ---------
        If you are upgrading from a release prior to 0.3.1, you may need to manually delete the files from your Python installation (egg and easy-install.pth) prior to invoking easy_install or pip.  For future upgrades, can force to latest version with:
        
        	easy_install -U AgileCLU
        
        
        Configuration 
        -------------
        After installing AgileCLU, run use the profile tool to generate the proper output to place in an /etc/agile/agile.conf configuration file.  You can create as many configuration profiles as you like, specifying to use them over the default agile.conf profile by specifying the -l option on any given command.
        
        	agileprofile
        
        Example output:
        
        ```agileprofile (AgileCLU 0.3.4)
        
        This tool generates Agile Storage profile text to be pasted into AgileCLU profile configuration
        files (eg. /etc/agile/agile.conf is the default).  The information should have been provided to
        you by Limelight Networks, often via a "welcome letter".  If you have questions regarding the
        account information, please contact support@llnw.com.
        
        Enter Agile username: testcompany
        Enter Agile password: 
        Re-enter Agile password: 
        Enter your egress hostname: global.mt.lldns.net
        Enter your egress base path: /testcompany
        Enter your ingest hostname: api.agile.lldns.net
        
        
        ### PASTE THE FOLLOWING IN YOUR PROFILE CONFIGURATION FILE ####
        
        [Identity]
        username = testcompany
        password = A4UsWnRpKOdNy0HNWDHY+Q==
        
        [Egress]
        protocol = http
        hostname = global.mt.lldns.net
        basepath = /testcompany
        
        [Ingest]
        protocol = https
        hostname = api.agile.lldns.net
