Description: ==============
        django-latency
        ==============
        
        django-latency is a django application that only contains middleware to simulate network
        latency on your local machine.  It causes your views to take several seconds to return.
        
        This helps you identify client-side code that relies on low-latency server side code,
        which is generally an anti-pattern.
        
        Like a runner training with weighted shoes, django-latency lets you feel the pain of 
        client-server dependencies.  
        
        
        Set Up
        =================
        Setting up django-latency is easy.  After it is installed in your environemnt and on 
        your path, simply add the middleware class to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES list::
        
            MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
                ...
                'latency.middleware.LatencyMiddleware',
                ...
            )
        
        django-latency optionally accepts a settings variable called LATENCY_MIDDLEWARE.  Currently, 
        LATENCY_MIDDLEWARE is a dictionary whose only key is "WAIT_TIME," a floating point value.
        
        For example::
        
            LATENCY_MIDDLEWARE = {
                'WAIT_TIME': 5.0
            }
