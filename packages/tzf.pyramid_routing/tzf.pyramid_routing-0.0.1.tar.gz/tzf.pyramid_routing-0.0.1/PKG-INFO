Description: Introduction:
        =============
        
        pyramid_routing is a convenience package, that helps loading routing defined and kept in separate list.
        
        Installation:
        =============
        
        pip install pyramid_routing
        
        Configuration:
        ==============
        
        To configure routing, you have to first include this package in your pyramid app:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            config.include('pyramid_routing')
        
        And add *routing_package* into you settings ini file. This setting should pinpoint the package containing routing.
        
        By default, routing should be defined in package's __init__.py  module and it's submodules in lists of dicts. lists should be named **routes**, and the dict format is the same one as add_route's method.
        
        __init__.py routes definition is read as is, and for convenience, is loaded at the end. This gives the opportunity to add routes catching all possibilities: ``/{match}``
        
        Module-defined routes will be loaded first, with module name as their prefix. if blog.py will contain:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
                routes = [
                    dict(name='blog:index', pattern='/'),
                    dict(name='blog:show', pattern="/show"),
                ]
        
        **blog:index** path will be */blog/*, while **blog:show** will become /blog/show
        
        TODOs:
        ======
        
        - read from all lists within package (with list name becoming routes prefix)
        - read routing from yml configuration
        
        
        Testing:
        ========
        
        To run tests, either type ``python setup.py tests`` or ``nosetests --cover-package=tzf.pyramid_routing --cover-tests --with-doctest --with-coverage``
