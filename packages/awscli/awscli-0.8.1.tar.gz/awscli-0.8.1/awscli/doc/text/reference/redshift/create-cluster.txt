**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new cluster. To create the cluster in virtual private cloud
(VPC), you must provide cluster subnet group name. If you don't
provide a cluster subnet group name or the cluster security group
parameter, Amazon Redshift creates a non-VPC cluster, it associates
the default cluster security group with the cluster. .

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--node-type"  (string)
   The node type to be provisioned for the cluster. For information
   about node types, go to Working with Clusters in the *Amazon
   Redshift Management Guide* .

   Valid Values: "dw.hs1.xlarge" | "dw.hs1.8xlarge" .

"--master-username"  (string)
   The user name associated with the master user account for the
   cluster that is being created.

   Constraints:

   * Must be 1 - 128 alphanumeric characters.

   * First character must be a letter.

   * Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can be found
     in Reserved Words in the Developer Guide.

"--master-user-password"  (string)
   The password associated with the master user account for the
   cluster that is being created.

   Constraints:

   * Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length.

   * Must contain at least one uppercase letter.

   * Must contain at least one lowercase letter.

   * Must contain one number.

   * Can be any printable ASCII character (ASCII code 33 to 126)
     except ' (single quote), " (double quote), , /, @, or space.

"--cluster-identifier"  (string)
   A unique identifier for the cluster. You use this identifier to
   refer to the cluster for any subsequent cluster operations such as
   deleting or modifying. The identifier also appears in the console.

   Example: "myexamplecluster"


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--number-of-nodes"  (integer)
   The number of compute nodes in the cluster. This parameter is
   required when the **--cluster-type** parameter is specified as
   "multi-node" .

   For information about determining how many nodes you need, go to
   Working with Clusters in the *Amazon Redshift Management Guide* .

   If you don't specify this parameter, you get a single-node cluster.
   When requesting a multi-node cluster, you must specify the number
   of nodes that you want in the cluster.

   Default: "1"

   Constraints: Value must be at least 1 and no more than 100.

"--availability-zone"  (string)
   The EC2 Availability Zone (AZ) in which you want to provision the
   cluster. For example, if you have several EC2 instances running in
   a specific Availability Zone, then you might want the cluster to be
   provisioned in the same zone in order to decrease network latency.

   Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the region
   that is specified by the endpoint.

   Example: "us-east-1d"

   Constraint: The specified Availability Zone must be in the same
   region as the current endpoint.

"--publicly-accessible"  (boolean)
   If "true" , the cluster can be accessed from a public network.

"--cluster-parameter-group-name"  (string)
   The name of the parameter group to be associated with this cluster.

   Default: The default cluster parameter group. For information about
   the default parameter group, go to Working with Amazon Redshift
   Parameter Groups

   Constraints:

   * Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

   * First character must be a letter.

   * Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

"--encrypted"  (boolean)
   If "true" , the data in cluster is encrypted at rest.

   Default: false

"--cluster-type"  (string)
   The type of the cluster. When cluster type is specified as

   * "single-node" , the **--number-of-nodes** parameter is not
     required.

   * "multi-node" , the **--number-of-nodes** parameter is required.

   Valid Values: "multi-node" | "single-node"

   Default: "multi-node"

"--vpc-security-group-ids"  (list of string)
   A list of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups to be
   associated with the cluster.

   Default: The default VPC security group is associated with the
   cluster.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--allow-version-upgrade"  (boolean)
   If "true" , upgrades can be applied during the maintenance window
   to the engine that is running on the cluster.

   When a new version of the engine is released, you can request that
   the service automatically apply upgrades during the maintenance
   window to the engine that is running on your cluster.

   Default: "true"

"--cluster-subnet-group-name"  (string)
   The name of a cluster subnet group to be associated with this
   cluster.

   If this parameter is not provided the resulting cluster will be
   deployed outside virtual private cloud (VPC).

"--automated-snapshot-retention-period"  (integer)
   The number of days that automated snapshots are retained. If the
   value is 0, automated snapshots are disabled. Even if automated
   snapshots are disabled, you can still create manual snapshots when
   you want with create-cluster-snapshot .

   Default: "1"

   Constraints: Must be a value from 0 to 35.

"--cluster-security-groups"  (list of string)
   A list of security groups to be associated with this cluster.

   Default: The default cluster security group for .

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--port"  (integer)
   The port number on which the cluster accepts incoming connections.

   The cluster is accessible only via the JDBC and ODBC connection
   strings. Part of the connection string requires the port on which
   the cluster will listen for incoming connections.

   Default: "5439"

   Valid Values: "1150-65535"

"--db-name"  (string)
   The name of the first database to be created when the cluster is
   created.

   To create additional databases after the cluster is created,
   connect to the cluster with a SQL client and use SQL commands to

   the Developer Guide.

   Default: "dev"

   Constraints:

   * Must contain 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters.

   maintenance can occur.

   Format: "ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi"

   Default: A 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block
   of time per region, occurring on a random day of the week. The
