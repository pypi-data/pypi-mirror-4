        Introduction
        ============
        
        tox require a virtualenv installed to run correctly. Since I sort of hate virtualenv I've created this recipe to run tox with buildout.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Add this to your buildout::
        
            [tox]
            recipe = gp.recipe.tox
        
        This will install a virtualenv with tox installed in `parts/tox/`
        
        It's recommended to add this to your `~/.buildout/default.cfg`::
        
            [buildout]
            tox-install-dir = /home/gawel/.buildout/tox
        
        This will install tox's virtualenv once for all your buildouts. You'll get a
        `bin/tox binary` to run tests
