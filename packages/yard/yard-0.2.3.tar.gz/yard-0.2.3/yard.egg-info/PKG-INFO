Description: YARD - Yet Another ROC Drawer
        =============================
        
        This is yet another Python package for drawing ROC curves. It also
        lets you draw precision-recall, accumulation and concentrated ROC
        (CROC) curves and calculate the AUC (area under curve) statistics.
        The significance of differences between AUC scores can also be
        tested using paired permutation tests.
        
        You may also be interested in CROC_, a similar package on the
        Python Package Index that implements ROC curves. ``yard`` was developed
        independently from CROC_, but several features of CROC have inspired
        similar ones in ``yard``.
