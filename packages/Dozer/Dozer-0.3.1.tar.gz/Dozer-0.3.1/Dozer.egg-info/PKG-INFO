Description: Dozer
        =====
        
        Dozer was originally a WSGI middleware version of Robert Brewer's
        `Dowser CherryPy tool <http://www.aminus.net/wiki/Dowser>`_ that
        displays information as collected by the gc module to assist in
        tracking down memory leaks.  It now also has middleware for profiling
        and for looking at logged messages.
        
        
        Tracking down memory leaks
        --------------------------
        
        Usage::
        
            from dozer import Dozer
        
            # my_wsgi_app is a WSGI application
            wsgi_app = Dozer(my_wsgi_app)
        
        Assuming you're serving your application on the localhost at port 5000,
        you can then load up ``http://localhost:5000/_dozer/index`` to view the
        gc info.
        
        
        Profiling requests
        ------------------
        
        Usage::
        
            from dozer import Profiler
        
            # my_wsgi_app is a WSGI application
            wsgi_app = Profiler(my_wsgi_app)
        
        Assuming you're serving your application on the localhost at port 5000,
        you can then load up ``http://localhost:5000/_profiler`` to view the
        list of recorded request profiles.

        of Dozer's profiler <http://mg.pov.lt/blog/profiling-with-dozer.html>`_.
        
        
        Inspecting log messages
        -----------------------
        
        Usage::
        
            from dozer import Logview
        
            # my_wsgi_app is a WSGI application
            wsgi_app = Logview(my_wsgi_app)
        
        Every text/html page served by your application will get some HTML and
        Javascript injected into the response body listing all logging messages
        produced by the thread that generated this response.
