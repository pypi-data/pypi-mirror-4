==============
Py-ProjectMill
==============

Python port of https://github.com/mapbox/projectmill

Currently only support ``--mill`` and ``--render``.

There are no requirements for Python 2.7, 3.2+, and pypy-1.9 unless you want to run the tests.
To run tests, first ``pip install nose testy`` and then just run ``nosetests``.
Alternatively, just run ``python setup.py test``.

The remainder of the documentation is adapted from the original project.

----

Need to generate a bunch of TileMill projects that are nearly identical and
then render them all out? What to script that? We gotcha covered.

Usage: ``projectmill <command> [options]``

Example: ``projectmill --mill -c config.example.json -t ../tilemill/``

Installation
============

Install from source with ``pip install -e .`` or ``python setup.py install``, or direct from the cheese shop with ``pip install py-projectmill``.
If you're using Python 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, or 3.1, you will need to ``pip install -r requirements-X.Y.txt`` (they don't include ``argparse``, which is required, and 2.5 needs ``simplejson``).

Tests pass with all versions from 2.5 - 3.3 and pypy-1.9, so it ought to work for just about everyone.

Configuration
=============

Configuration is expected as a json file which contains an array as the root
object. See ``config.example.json`` for an example. Each element in the array
should be an object which can have the following keys::

    source        REQUIRED The source project, generally the name of folder it
                  lives in.

    destination   REQUIRED The destination project name.

    mml           A json snippet which will be merged on top of the project's mml
                  file. To clear out an option set it to 'null'

    cartoVars     A json object containing key value pairs which can be use to
                  override variables in in carto stylesheets.

    MBmeta        MBTiles: A json object containing key value pairs which will be added to
                  a rendered MBtiles export.

    Additionally, the following options will be passed to TileMill's export commnd

    format        Export format (png|pdf|svg|mbtiles). (Default: undefined)

    bbox          Array containing coordinates of bounding box to export. (Default: undefined)

    minzoom       MBTiles: minimum zoom level to export. (Default: undefined)

    maxzoom       MBTiles: maximum zoom level to export. (Default: undefined)

    width         Image: image width in pixels. (Default: 400)

    height        Image: image height in pixels. (Default: 400)

    bufferSize    Mapnik render buffer size. (Default: 128)


Commands
========

ProjectMill accepts the following commands. They can be issued either
individually or together::

    --mill      Generates new tilemill projects based on configuration.

    --render    Renders projects that are present in configuration and have been milled.

    --upload    Uploads projects that are present in configuration and have been rendered.


Options
=======

We also accept the following options::

    -t      Path to the TileMill install

    -c      specify a configuration file. (Defaults: ./config.json)

    -p      Path to TileMill project folder. (Defaults: ~/Documents/Mapbox)

    -f      Replace existing projects (together with mill) or existing projects and exports (together with render).
