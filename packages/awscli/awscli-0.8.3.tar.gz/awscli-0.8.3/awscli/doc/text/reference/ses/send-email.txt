send-email
**********


DESCRIPTION
===========

Composes an email message based on input data, and then immediately
queues the message for sending.

Warning: If you have not yet requested production access to Amazon SES, then
  you will only be able to send email to and from verified email
  addresses and domains. For more information, go to the Amazon SES
  Developer Guide .

The total size of the message cannot exceed 10 MB.

Amazon SES has a limit on the total number of recipients per message:
The combined number of To:, CC: and BCC: email addresses cannot exceed
50. If you need to send an email message to a larger audience, you can
divide your recipient list into groups of 50 or fewer, and then call
Amazon SES repeatedly to send the message to each group.

For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (To:,
CC: and BCC:) is counted against your *sending quota* - the maximum
number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period. For information
about your sending quota, go to the "Managing Your Sending Activity"
section of the`Amazon SES Developer Guide
<http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide>`_ .
