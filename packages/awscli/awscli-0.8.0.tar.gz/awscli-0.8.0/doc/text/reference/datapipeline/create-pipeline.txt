create-pipeline
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new empty pipeline. When this action succeeds, you can then
use the put-pipeline-definition action to populate the pipeline.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws datapipeline create-pipeline
     --name <value>
     --unique-id <value>
     [--description <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--name"  (string)
   The --name of the new pipeline. You can use the same --name for
   multiple pipelines associated with your AWS account, because AWS
   Data Pipeline assigns each new pipeline a unique pipeline
   identifier.

"--unique-id"  (string)
   A unique identifier that you specify. This identifier is not the
   same as the pipeline identifier assigned by AWS Data Pipeline. You
   are responsible for defining the format and ensuring the uniqueness
   of this identifier. You use this parameter to ensure idempotency
   during repeated calls to CreatePipeline. For example, if the first
   call to create-pipeline does not return a clear success, you can
   pass in the same unique identifier and pipeline --name combination
   on a subsequent call to CreatePipeline. create-pipeline ensures
   that if a pipeline already exists with the same --name and unique
   identifier, a new pipeline will not be created. Instead, you'll
   receive the pipeline identifier from the previous attempt. The
   uniqueness of the --name and unique identifier combination is
   scoped to the AWS account or IAM user credentials.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--description"  (string)
   The --description of the new pipeline.
