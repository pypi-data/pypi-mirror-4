Hacking
=======

If you want to work on the tracking code you should have a look at the original
``PiwikTracking.php`` in the Piwik source tree. There's also a
``PiwikTracking.java`` implementation in the release.

To run the unit tests you need to:

- Create a new Piwik site
- Configure your environment
- Enable tracker debugging

Creating a new site
-------------------

You want to create a **new site** specifically for running the unit tests as to
not pollute a real site with test data.

Configuring your environment
----------------------------

The tests assume that the following variables are set in your shell
environment::

    PIWIK_SITE_ID = '<ID of your test site>'
    PIWIK_TRACKING_API_URL = '<Your Piwik tracker API URL>'
    PIWIK_ANALYTICS_API_URL = '<Your Piwik API URL>'
    PIWIK_TOKEN_AUTH = '<Your Piwik auth token>'
    PIWIK_GOAL_ID = None

``PIWIK_TRACKING_API_URL`` must contain the URL to your Piwik install's
/piwik.php, something like 'http://example.com/piwik.php'.
``PIWIK_TRACKING_API_URL`` must contain the URL to your Piwik install's root.

The auth token must have admin access for the site defined in
``PIWIK_SITE_ID``. The ``goal id`` doesn't have to be set, the goal can be
autogenerated by the tests.

Please let me know if you need a different way of defining those settings.

Enabling tracker debugging
--------------------------

Some unit tests parse the output of the tracker script, so you have to **enable
debugging** in your Piwik install's ``/piwik.php``::

    $GLOBALS['PIWIK_TRACKER_DEBUG'] = true;
