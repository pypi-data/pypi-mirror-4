Description: This package provides simple tools to process data from the CMIP5 archive distributed 
        by the Earth System Grid Federation.
        
        NOTE: This package requires a package named 'pyesgf' that is not yet available on PYPI.
        
        This package was developed by F. B. Laliberte and P. J. Kushner in the Atmospheric
        Physics Group at the University of Toronto in 2011 and 2012. The main purpose of this
        package is to provide simple tools to climate scientists and to help the 
        "ExArch: Climate analytics on distributed exascale data archives" G8 Research Initiative grant.
        
        FBL and PJK were funded by NSERC.
