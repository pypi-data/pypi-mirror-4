Description: =============
        PyMarkovChain
        =============
        
        PyMarkovChain supplies an easy-to-use implementation of a markov chain text generator.
        To use it, you can simply do
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from pymarkovchain import MarkovChain
        
            # To generate the markov chain's language model, in case it's not present
            MarkovChain().generateDatabase("This is some language to analyze")
            # To let the markov chain generate some text, execute
        	MarkovChain().generateString()
        
        To store its data, PyMarkovChain simply uses pickle to dump all of its data to disk.
        This entails that you have to use the same version of python to store the data and to
        restore the data, as pickle is one of those things that have changed from python2 to python3.
