        Loslassa
        ========
        
        Workflow
        --------
        
        Start
        '''''
        **not implemented yet**
        
        ::
        
            loslassa start */path/to/project*
        
        Creates a new project with a basic structure and configuration
        similar to sphinx-quickstart only simpler and tailored to only HTML output.
        
        Play
        ''''
        Playing with the source and create your page. Add content and see the
        changes right away thanks to local server with automatic
        rebuild of the web pages::
        
            cd */path/to/project*
            loslassa play
        
        Starts a local development server reachable on http://localhost:8080.
        All files in project folder are being watched and if something changes
        the project is rebuild.
        
        Publish
        '''''''
        **not implemented yet**
        
        This part is a bit vague still but basically it should simply push the
        generated pages to the server, by maintaining them in a git repository
        
        First time publishing would clone the repository bare to the web space and
        set it to be origin from then on
        ... or summin like that, didn't think that through yet::
        
            cd */path/to/project*
            loslassa loslassa
        
        Customize
        '''''''''
        This is not thought out yet, but I imagine that additional customization
        can be done easily by expanding the settings in the sphinx conf.py and
        do more involved stuff via sphinx extensions.
