    <p><b>Q:</b> What kind of expressions can a cell contain?<br>
      <b>A:</b> A cell can contain any normal Python expression such as
      a
      list comprehension or a generator expression. However, it cannot
      contain statements such as
    </p>
    <pre>for i in xrange(10): pass<br></pre>
    <p>
      If you want to program more complex algorithms then use the macro
      editor.<br>
      There, you can define functions that use arbitrary Python code and
      is
      callable from any cell.
    </p>
    <p><b>Example:</b><br>
      Type in the macro editor:
    </p>
    <pre>def factorize(number):<br>    """Silly factorizing algorithm for demonstration purposes only"""<br>    counter = 1<br>    result = []<br>    while counter &lt;= number:<br>        if number&nbsp;% counter == 0:<br>            result.append(counter)<br>        counter += 1<br>    return result</pre>
    <p>And in the cell:
    </p>
    <pre> factorize(25)</pre>
    <p>Result is:
    </p>
    <pre> [1 5 25]</pre>
    <p><b>Q:</b> What are the boundaries for the number of
      rows/columns/sheets?<br>
      <b>A:</b> These are limited by your memory (and maybe your stack
      restriction
      if any). However, the grid is restricted to a number that changes
      with
      row size.
      For standard size (GTK), 80 000 000 rows can be displayed.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Is the new file-format considered stable, or will it
      change again?<br>
      <b>A:</b> The new file format is stable. This means that future
      versions of Pyspread will be able to read the old format.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Q:</b> Can pyspread still read the old format?<br>
      <b>A:</b> Unfortunately not. If you have old pys files, install
      both
      versions of pyspread and copy the cell contents via the Clipboard
      from
      the old to the new version. However, cell formatting cannot be
      preserved this way.<br>
