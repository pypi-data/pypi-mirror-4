0.9.0 - 2012-10-01
===================
Improve the model_controller logging and spawning process.  fixes #33
User INFO messages in parellel_manager, since a DEBUG logger hangs
Avoid conflict in naming by importing time as timer.
Manage an EasyLogger for testing in the setUp and tearDown methods
Remove existing handlers when using the EasyLogger
Apparently setting the logger level to logger.DEBUG hangs everything.
Add test to start a run on land
Add sleeping and debug messages. Set testing logger to DEBUG by default.
Merge remote branch 'origin/larva_alex'
when failing a consumer, change get_data.value to False so the remaining particles crash
Wrap more functionality in a try/catch to avoid locking woes
Add logger when needed...
Test if we are dropped particles on land to start with.
Always close nc files and set particle_get to False
some fixes for large particles, asastochastic
working stochastic
initial commit of asastochastic.py for computing probability grids

===================
fixing alex's inability to run the tests.  comments #29
Merge remote branch 'origin/larva_alex'
Implement Settlement, fixes #27
first stab at paegan issue #29
Merge remote branch 'origin/larva_alex'
Return something from getboundingpolygon
Add settlement
Add check for CPU count
changes to cdm for issue #26
Merge remote branch 'origin/larva_alex'
Fix the interp caching so we don't add spaces to the cache file
Don't subset the time_indexes until looping
Simplify the log messages when forcing particles
Fix bug when using 'nearest' time_method
Make the time_method configuration on ModelController
Get the time indexes right for forcing and saving particle locations.
Fix normalization of indexes on particle class.
changes to timevar so you can find the indices of nearest without a list or array
Move export functions to their own file and to classmethods
fixes to cdm

0.8.8 - 2012-08-24
===================
Fix the timevar tests
.
more fixes to t bounds handling in get_values in commondataset
fixing get_tind_from_bound implementation in get_values
.
added getvariableinfo on common dataset
changes to cdm to add getbbox from the commondataset (still need variable reference
same temp and salt fixes added to the netcdf output
Stick particles if no shoreline type is given
Implement a trackline output in GeoJson.  fixes #25
Normalize the length of locations/temps/salts on export
Factor the timestep calculation into a method
Don't try to save the particles returned as -1
Add the default output directory to .gitignore
Add a close method to the EasyLogger
Fix errors in model controller tests
Zip up shapefiles
Merge branch 'larva_alex'
update test with easylogger
working EasyLogger
added EasyLogger to multi_process_logging
added option to run particles with nearest OR linear interp
adding some comments, removing prints
added linear interp between timesteps for u, v, w, temp, salt
Change shapefile creation, test the output formats
added consumer messages to the logger for failed parallel tasks, also implemented a before index in cdm/timevar
changed broken changes back temporarily
