create-vpn-connection
*********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new VPN connection between an existing VPN gateway and
customer gateway. The only supported connection type is ipsec.1.

The response includes information that you need to configure your
customer gateway, in XML format. We recommend you use the command line
version of this operation ( "ec2-create-vpn-connection" ), which takes
an "-f" option (for format) and returns configuration information
formatted as expected by the vendor you specified, or in a generic,
human readable format. For information about the command, go to "ec2
-create-vpn-connection" in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud Command
Line Reference.

Warning: We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation
  because the response contains sensitive cryptographic information
  for configuring your customer gateway.If you decide to shut down
  your VPN connection for any reason and then create a new one, you
  must re-configure your customer gateway with the new information
  returned from this call.
