delete-server-certificate
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes the specified server certificate.

Warning: If you are using a server certificate with Elastic Load Balancing,
  deleting the certificate could have implications for your
  application. If Elastic Load Balancing doesn't detect the deletion
  of bound certificates, it may continue to use the certificates. This
  could cause Elastic Load Balancing to stop accepting traffic. We
  recommend that you remove the reference to the certificate from
  Elastic Load Balancing before using this command to delete the
  certificate. For more information, go to DeleteLoadBalancerListeners
  in the *Elastic Load Balancing API Reference* .
