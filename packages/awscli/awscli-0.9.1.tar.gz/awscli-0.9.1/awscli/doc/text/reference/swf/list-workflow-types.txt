list-workflow-types
*******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns information about workflow types in the specified domain. The
results may be split into multiple pages that can be retrieved by
making the call repeatedly.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain --name to limit the
  action to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf list-workflow-types
     --domain <value>
     --registration-status <value>
     [--next-page-token <value>]
     [--name <value>]
     [--reverse-order ]
     [--maximum-page-size <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The --name of the --domain in which the workflow types have been
   registered.

"--registration-status"  (string)
   Specifies the registration status of the workflow types to list.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--next-page-token"  (string)
   If on a previous call to this method a "NextPageToken" was
   returned, the results are being paginated. To get the next page of
   results, repeat the call with the returned token and all other
   arguments unchanged.

"--name"  (string)
   If specified, lists the workflow type with this name.

"--reverse-order"  (boolean)
   When set to "true" , returns the results in reverse order. By
   default the results are returned in ascending alphabetical order of
   the "--name" of the workflow types.

"--maximum-page-size"  (integer)
   The maximum number of results returned in each page. The default is
   100, but the caller can override this value to a page size
   *smaller* than the default. You cannot specify a page size greater
   than 100. Note that the number of types may be less than the
   maxiumum page size, in which case, the returned page will have
   fewer results than the --maximum-page-size specified.
