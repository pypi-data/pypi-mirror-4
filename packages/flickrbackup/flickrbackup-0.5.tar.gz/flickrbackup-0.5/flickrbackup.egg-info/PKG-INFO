Description: Flickr Incremental Backup
        =========================
        
        A tool to incrementally backup your photos from `Flickr <http://flickr.com>`_.
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        1. Install Python 2.7 (http://python.org) if you don't have it already:
        
        2. Install pip::
        
            $ wget http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
            $ python2.7 distribute_setup.py
            $ easy_install pip
        
        3. Install package from PyPI::
        
            $ pip install flickrbackup
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Note: You must have a Flickr Pro account to use this tool, since Flickr only
        allows access to original-scale images for Pro members.
        
        The first time you run flickrbackup, you should specify a start date, using the
        format YYYY-MM-DD::
        
            $ flickrbackup -f 2012-02-28 -v photos
        
        This will launch a web browser and ask you to authorize flickrbackup with your
        Flickr account, if you haven't already. You may need to restart the script
        after this step.
        
        Once authorised, flickrbackup will download all photos and videos for the
        authorised account that have been created or updated on or after the "from" date
        (February 28th, 2012 in this case) into the directory specified ("photos" in
        this case). Items are organised into subfolders by set and the year, month and
        day they were taken. If an item appears in multiple sets, it will be copied into
        both set directories. Metadata such as the title, description, tags and other
        information will be placed in a file with a ".txt" extension next to the image
        file. The image file name is based on the Flickr id of the image.
        
        After the first successful run, a special file named ".stamp" will be placed in
        the download directory, containing the date of the last backup. This allows
        flickrbackup to be run again without the "-f" argument, for example in a
        scheduled nightly "cron" job, picking up from where it left off::
        
            flickrbackup /path/to/photos
        
        Here, we have also omitted the "-v" (verbose) flag, which means only errors and
        important messages are output to the console.
        
        To see further help, run::
        
            $ flickrbackup --help
        
        Running on a server or NAS device
        ---------------------------------
        
        You may find it useful to run flickrbackup on a server or a device such as the
        Netgear ReadyNAS Duo as a nightly scheduled job (e.g. using ``cron``), to back
        up new or changed photos regularly.
        
        In this case, you may find it difficult to authorise the app with Flickr on
        its first run, as this requires a web browser. The solution is to run it once
        on your local machine, and then copy the authorisation token file that is
        stored in ``~/.flickr`` to the server or NAS device::
        
            $ scp -r ~/.flickr user@server:~/
