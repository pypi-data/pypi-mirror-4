Description: 
        	A wrapper around the USGS Water Information System JSON API that provides native Python access.
        	Documentation is available at Read the Docs (https://usgs-api.readthedocs.org/en/latest). The code and
        	documentation are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
        
        	Please note that the module name is usgs, not usgs-api for importing.
        
        	If you would like to use the functionality to return pandas objects, you must install `pandas <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas/>`_
        	 separately as it is not a hard dependency (the module will load and run without that functionality and will raise an error if you attempt to use
        	 it. Windows users may need to install `pandas <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas/>`_ separately via the binary installer. Pandas, in turn, requires numpy, which may also
        	need to be installed using the binary installer if you do not already have it installed.
