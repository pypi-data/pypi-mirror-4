Description: Taskreport
        ==========
        
        Taskreport is a simple tool to generate HTML reports from your Taskwarrior
        task list and send them by email. 
        
        The list of features includes:
        
        * generating an html report containing the sections defined in the configuration file.
        * sending the report to one or more email addresses (using the SMTP credentials
          defined in the configuration file).
        * outputting the report to a local file.
        * customizing the generated html with a template (using the Jinja template
          engine).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You have several options to install Taskreport:
        
        * use ``pip install taskreport`` or ``easy_install taskreport`` to install
          directly from the Python Package Index.
        * use ``python setup.py install`` from the package archive
        
        **Note:** You will need to install Jinja to be able to use the templating feature
        (this is optional).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A sample configuration file is distributed with this package and should be
        located at ``share/config.sample``. All the configuration options are
        commented. By default, ``taskreport`` tries to look at ``~/.taskreport`` for
        the configuration file. You can specify another location by using the ``-c``
        command-line option.
        
        The configuration file contains: 
        
        * a ``SMTP`` section for the SMTP credentials of the account to be used to send
          the report email
        * a ``MAIL`` section to define the email subject and recipient(s)
        * one section for each section to be included in the report: the section name
          in the configuration file will become the section title in the generated HTML.
          The section should only contain one ``filter`` option which should follow
          Taskwarrior's filtering syntax: this option will be fed directly to Taskwarrior
          to generate the list of tasks to include in the report.
        
        Command-line options
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The available command line options and their meaning can be found by typing
        ``taskreport -h``. Certain options can be defined both in the configuration
        file and on the command-line. For those options, the command-line has
        precedence over the configuration file.
        
        Template
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Using a template is optional: Taskreport has a basic default layout. If you
        wish to customize the layout, you can specify the location of a template file
        by using the ``-t`` option on the command line.
        
        The template file will be rendered by the Jinja template engine and thus must
        comply to Jinja's syntax. You should refer to `Jinja's official documentation
        <http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/>`__ for more details.
        
        The template file will receive as an environment variable a ``section_list``
        variable. This is a list of dictionaries, one for each section. A section's
        dictionary contains two keys: ``title`` for the section title, and
        ``task_list`` which is a JSON object containing the output you would get by
        using Taskwarrior's export command with this section's filter rule.
        
        A sample template file located at ``share/email_template.html`` should have been
        distributed with this package.
