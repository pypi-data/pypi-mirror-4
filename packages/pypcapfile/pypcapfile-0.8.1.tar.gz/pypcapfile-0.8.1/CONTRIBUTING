CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

Here's a few simple requests I have for code contributions:

* Please ensure all tests pass (pull requests are sent to
[travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/kisom/pypcapfile).
* Please update any comments in modified functions, and update the READMEs. I
will regenerate the Github page based on the changed README.
* Add your name and info to the AUTHORs file (if you want).

Thanks!
