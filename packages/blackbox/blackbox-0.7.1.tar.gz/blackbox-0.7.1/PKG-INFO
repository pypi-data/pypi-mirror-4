Description: This python module - simply called blackbox from
                 here on - is intended to  encapsulate most of the low level IRC
                 protocol into handy, easily callable methods of an IRC object that
                 contains the socket object.  It is mainly meant to be used in bots,
                 but can of course be used for any other application communicating
                 with an IRC server as
                 well.
