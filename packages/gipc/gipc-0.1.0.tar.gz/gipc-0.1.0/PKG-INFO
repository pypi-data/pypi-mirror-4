Description: What can gipc do for you?
        =========================
        With ``gipc`` (pronunciation “gipsy”) child processes and gevent can
        easily be used within one Python application. ``gipc`` provides
        gevent-aware ``multiprocessing.Process``-based child processes and
        gevent-cooperative inter-process communication.
        
        
        Isn't this achievable with just gevent+multiprocessing?
        =======================================================
        Yes, but it requires care: On Unix, child process creation via Python's
        ``multiprocessing`` package in the context of ``gevent`` might yield an
        undesired event loop state in the child and most likely breaks your application
        in some way. Furthermore, blocking method calls such as ``join()`` on a
        ``multiprocessing.Process`` or the ``send()``/``recv()`` methods on a
        ``multiprocessing.Connection`` are not gevent-cooperative. ``gipc`` overcomes
        these challenges  for you in a straight-forward fashion and allows for simple
        integration of child processes in your application -- on POSIX-compliant
        systems as well as on Windows.
