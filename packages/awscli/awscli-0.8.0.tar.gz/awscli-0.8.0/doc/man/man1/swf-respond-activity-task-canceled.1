.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified by the
\fB\-\-task\-token\fP was successfully canceled. Additional \fB\-\-details\fP can be
optionally provided using the \fB\-\-details\fP argument.
.sp
These \fB\-\-details\fP (if provided) appear in the \fBActivityTaskCanceled\fP event
added to the workflow history.
.IP Warning
Only use this operation if the \fBcanceled\fP flag of a
record\-activity\-task\-heartbeat request returns \fBtrue\fP and if the activity
can be safely undone or abandoned.
.RE
.sp
A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled until it is closed.
Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is processing it. A task is
closed after it has been specified in a call to  respond\-activity\-task\-completed
, RespondActivityTaskCanceled,  respond\-activity\-task\-failed , or the task has
\fI\%timed out\fP .
.sp
\fBAccess Control\fP
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the domain name to limit the action to only
specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\(aqs parameters.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails by
throwing \fBOperationNotPermitted\fP . For \-\-details and example IAM policies, see
\fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP

The \fB\-\-task\-token\fP of the  ActivityTask .
.IP Warning
The \fB\-\-task\-token\fP is generated by the service and should be treated as an
opaque value. If the task is passed to another process, its \fB\-\-task\-token\fP
must also be passed. This enables it to provide its progress and respond
with results.
