  	<title>Installation</title>

	<para>Grab the SPADE deliverable package at <ulink url="http://spade2.googleprojects.com">http://spade2.googleprojects.com</ulink>. Uncompress it and launch the <command>configure.py</command> script in order to configure the platform. You can provide a parameter to this script, which is the machine's hostname and that will be used as the platform's name. Finally, launch the <command>runspade.py</command> script and see your platform rise before your eyes. After a few seconds you should see the green word <command>Done</command> on the screen confirming that the platform was succesfully launched. In a nutshell:</para>

    <screen>
$ tar xvzf spade-2.0.0.tar.gz
$ cd spade
$ python configure.py myhost.myprovider.com
$ python runspade.py
</screen>
