        PyPPI (Python Private Package Index) is a Django application that provides a private
        `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
        Originally forked from the `DjangoPyPi`_ project, this project gets ideas and code from
        `chishop`_ and `DjangoPyPi2`_.
        
        The reason of this project is that in big environment we need features not provided by the orginal packages:
        
        * Ability to allow/deny package registration
        * Ability to allow/deny package distribution upload
        * Different levels of visibility and access to the packages
        * Create Teams with proper access level
        * webhooks
        * improved rest interface
        
        
        **If you need to migrate from DjangoPyPi, the best method is to run the ` command**
