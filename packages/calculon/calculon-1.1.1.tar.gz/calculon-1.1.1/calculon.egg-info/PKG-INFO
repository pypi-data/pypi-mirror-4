Description: # Calculon
        This project is a customizable implementation of the producer-consumer pattern using Python's multithreading and multiprocessing capabilities. Calculon allows you to:
        
        * define a custom producer that puts values into a queue;
        * define a custom consumer that processes values obtained from the queue;
        * choose between multiprocessing or multithreading option to run the functions;
        * pass arbitrary information to and back from each of the producer / consumer;
        
        This package will be helpful to someone who is looking to use a producer-consumer
        pattern to perform simple parallel computing tasks.
