About this release
======================================

- Run the ``refresh.sh`` script (read its code ;)) to grab bits from a regular mapnik source/svn tree inside the distribution (the cpp bindings & internal agg includes)
- Some of The difference between this egg and the classical mapnik bindings :

    - ``mapnik.paths`` is not constructed at installation time as we cannot guess values.
      It has the same apis but to construct the variables, it will use mapnik-config.
      Take care about having **mapnik-config** inside your environment !
