Mac OSX strings
***************

.. versionadded:: 1.8

Mac OSX .strings files are used for some Cocoa / Carbon application
localization, such as for the iPhone, iPod, and OSX. They are somewhat similar
to Java properties, and therefore :doc:`prop2po </commands/prop2po>` and
po2prop are used for conversion.
