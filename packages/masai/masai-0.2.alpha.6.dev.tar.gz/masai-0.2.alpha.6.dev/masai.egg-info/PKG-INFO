        Warning
        =======
        
        	|masai| is still experimental and under active development. 
        	It is not mature nor stable. 
        	Its current design is subject to major changes, reorganizations, bugs and crashes!!!.
        	
        	**Should I say? be patient as I expect a fully working version with the upcoming 0.2 stable release.**
        	
        	
        What is |masai|?
        ==================
        
        |masai| is a software written in python and partially in fortran.
        
        It (will) provides a general framework for the processing, analysis and modelling 
        of Solid State NMR spectra.
        
        A *GUI* application allows users to make basic processing and fitting of NMR spectra
        (for now limited to the Bruker format).
        
        The *API* should also be accessible to be included in other programs.

        Release history
        ================
        
        * v0.2.alpha, 2012-11-29 -- This release should be ok for fitting 1D spectra, but have a lot of limitations for processing the spectra.
        
        * v0.1, 2012-11-24 -- initial experimental release
