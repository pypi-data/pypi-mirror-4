start-gateway
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation starts a gateway that you previously shut down (see
shutdown-gateway ). After the gateway starts, you can then make other
API calls, your applications can read from or write to the gateway's
storage volumes and you will be able to take snapshot backups.

Note: When you make a request, you will get a 200 OK success response
  immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to be
  ready. You should call describe-gateway-information and check the
  status before making any additional API calls. For more information,
  see  activate-gateway .

To specify which gateway to start, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of the gateway in your request.
