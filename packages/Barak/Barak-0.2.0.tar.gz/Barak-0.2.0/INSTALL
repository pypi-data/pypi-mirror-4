The easiest way install is to download the tarball from the pypi
website and then run:

  python setup.py install

You may need to put a 'sudo' in front of this. 

A better way to install (which allow for easy uninstallation) is by
using pip:

  pip install barak

but you need to have pip
(http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html) installed.
