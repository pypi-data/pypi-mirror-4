0.4.0
=====
- [bug] Using dogpile.core 0.4.0 now, fixes a critical
  bug whereby dogpile pileup could occur on first value
  get across multiple processes, due to reliance upon
  a non-shared creation time.  This is dogpile.core
  issue #1.

- [bug] Fixed missing __future__ with_statement
  directive in region.py.

0.3.1
=====
- [bug] Fixed the mako_cache plugin which was not yet
  covered, and wasn't implementing the mako plugin
  API correctly; fixed docs as well.  Courtesy
  Ben Hayden.

- [bug] Fixed setup so that the tests/* directory
  isn't yanked into the install.  Courtesy Ben Hayden.

0.3.0
=====
- [feature] get() method now checks expiration time
  by default.   Use ignore_expiration=True
  to bypass this.

- [feature] Added new invalidate() method.  Sets the current
  timestamp as a minimum value that all retrieved
  values must be created after.  Is honored by the
  get_or_create() and get() methods. #7

- [bug] Fixed bug whereby region.get() didn't
  work if the value wasn't present.  #8

0.2.4
=====
- Fixed py3k issue with config string coerce,

0.2.3
=====
- support "min_compress_len" and "memcached_expire_time"
  with python-memcached backend.  Tests courtesy
  Justin Azoff #3

- Add support for coercion of string config values
  to Python objects - ints, "false", "true", "None".
  #4

- Added support to DBM file lock to allow reentrant
  access per key within a single thread, so that
  even though the DBM backend locks for the whole file,
  a creation function that calls upon a different
  key in the cache can still proceed.  #5

- Fixed DBM glitch where multiple readers
  could be serialized.

- Adjust bmemcached backend to work with newly-repaired
  bmemcached calling API (see bmemcached
  ef206ed4473fec3b639e).

  namespace thing worked out.
