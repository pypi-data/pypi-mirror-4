.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
terminate\-job\-flows shuts a list of job flows down. When a job flow is shut
down, any step not yet completed is canceled and the EC2 instances on which the
job flow is running are stopped. Any log files not already saved are uploaded to
Amazon S3 if a LogUri was specified when the job flow was created.
.sp
The call to terminate\-job\-flows is asynchronous. Depending on the configuration
of the job flow, it may take up to 5\-20 minutes for the job flow to completely
terminate and release allocated resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.
