Change history
==============

1.0.3
=====

* Code cleanup.

1.0.2
=====

* :program:`celery mon` now the respects :option:`--pidfile` option
  (Issue #14).

    Fix contributed by Atsuo Ishimoto.

1.0.1
=====

* Distribution did not include static files (Issue #17).

1.0.0
=====

0.5.0
=====

* Now supports Celery 3.x

0.4.0
=====

* No longer supports Python 2.4

* Requires Celery >= 2.3

* Package renamed from ``celerymonitor`` -> ``celerymon``.

    The long name was used because of relative imports clashes,
    but this is no longer an issue since we have dropped
    Python 2.4 support and can force absolute imports.

* celerymon can now be daemonized using the `--detach` option.

    Additional daemon related options are available, see ``celerymon --help``
    for a list of these.
