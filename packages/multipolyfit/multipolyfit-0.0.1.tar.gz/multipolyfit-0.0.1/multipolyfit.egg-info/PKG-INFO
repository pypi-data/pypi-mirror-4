Description: Multivariate Polynomial Fit
        ===========================
        
        Holds a python function to perform multivariate polynomial regression in Python
        using NumPy
        
        [See related question on
        stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10988082/multivariate-polynomial-regression-with-numpy)
        
        This is similar to numpy's polyfit function but works on multiple covariates

        This is not commonly used method.  
        Probably you should look into some sort of L1 regularization.
