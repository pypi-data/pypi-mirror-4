 Python/C++ Bob Extension Building Support
===========================================

This package provides a ``pkg-config`` bridge for Python/C++ extensions for
`Bob <http://www.idiap.ch/software/bob/>`_. You use this package by including it
in the ``setup_requires`` field of your ``setup.py`` file.

Building with ``zc.buildout`` is possible using the ``develop`` recipe in
`xbob.buildout <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xbob.buildout>`_. Follow the
instructions described on that package for this recipe.
