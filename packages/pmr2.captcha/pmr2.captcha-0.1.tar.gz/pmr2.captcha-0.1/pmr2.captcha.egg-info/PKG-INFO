Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package adds the support of captchas on spam-prone forms on a given
        Plone instance.  Currently this package extends the user registration
        form from the package plone.app.users with the support for captcha views
        following the format found in `collective.captcha`_.  A compatible
        package must be installed before the captcha will function.
        
        .. _collective.captcha: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.captcha
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package requires and is for Plone 4 or later.  Plone 3.x does not
        depend on `plone.app.users`_ for the user registration form.  To add the
        support for captchas on the form for those versions of Plone are done
        using the ZMI using the TTW editor on the registration template and
        script files.
        
        .. _plone.app.users: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.users
