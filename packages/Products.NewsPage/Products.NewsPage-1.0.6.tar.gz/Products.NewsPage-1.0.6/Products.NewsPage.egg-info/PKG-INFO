Description: Products.NewsPage is a simple product that enables displaying a
        collection of news items in a folder default view, or by using the
        macro in a custom page template.
        
        The first 3 news items can be pinned by editing the NewsPage, and one
        can also select which review state and paths to include/exclude.
        
        To use the macro, try something like:
        
        <metal:block tal:define="xyz python:request.set('newspage', context.newspage_object)">
          <span metal:use-macro="context/newspage_macros/macros/listing" />
        </metal:block>
