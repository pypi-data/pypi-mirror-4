delete-cluster
**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes a previously provisioned cluster. A successful response from
the web service indicates that the request was received correctly. If
a final cluster snapshot is requested the status of the cluster will
be "final-snapshot" while the snapshot is being taken, then it's
"deleting" once Amazon Redshift begins deleting the cluster. Use
describe-clusters to monitor the status of the deletion. The delete
operation cannot be canceled or reverted once submitted. .
