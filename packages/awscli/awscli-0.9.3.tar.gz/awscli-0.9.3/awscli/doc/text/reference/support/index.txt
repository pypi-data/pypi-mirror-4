DESCRIPTION
===========

The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need
detailed information about the AWS Support actions and data types.
This service enables you to manage with your AWS Support cases
programmatically. It is built on the AWS Query API programming model
and provides HTTP methods that take parameters and return results in
JSON format.

The AWS Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor
features. You can retrieve a list of checks you can run on your
resources, specify checks to run and refresh, and check the status of
checks you have submitted.

The following list describes the AWS Support case management actions:

* >>**<<Service names, issue categories, and available severity
  levels. ** The actions describe-services and describe-severity-
  levels enable you to obtain AWS service names, service codes,
  service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these
  values when you call the create-case action.

* **Case Creation, case details, and case resolution** . The actions
  create-case , describe-cases , and resolve-case enable you to create
  AWS Support cases, retrieve them, and resolve them.

* **Case communication** . The actions describe-communications and
  add-communication-to-case enable you to retrieve and add
  communication to AWS Support cases.

The following list describes the actions available from the AWS
Support service for Trusted Advisor:

* describe-trusted-advisor-checks returns the list of checks that you
  can run against your AWS resources.

* Using the CheckId for a specific check returned by
  DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call describe-trusted-advisor-
  check-result  and obtain a new result for the check you specified.

* Using describe-trusted-advisor-check-summaries , you can get
  summaries for a set of Trusted Advisor checks.

* refresh-trusted-advisor-check enables you to request that Trusted
  Advisor run the check again.

* describe-trusted-advisor-check-refresh-statuses gets statuses on the
  checks you are running.

For authentication of requests, the AWS Support uses Signature Version
4 Signing Process .

See the AWS Support Developer Guide for information about how to use
this service to manage create and manage your support cases, and how
to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.
