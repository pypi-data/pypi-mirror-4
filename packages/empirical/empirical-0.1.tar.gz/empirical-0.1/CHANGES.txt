0.1

What works:

* Basic support for empirical interpolation method is implemented. The API may
  change significantly in future releases.

* Method of fundamental solutions, along with basic domain/segment codes.

* Quadrature generators all pass some basic tests (code is thanks to mpspack
  and lglnodes.m):
  - Periodic trapezoid
  - Trapezoid
  - Gaussian
  - Clenshaw-Curtis
  - Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto

* Interpolation codes have been written, using the following algorithms:
  - Newton interpolating polynomial (nested form)
  - Lagrange interpolating polynomial (uses slow method for cardinal
    polynomials, probably numerically unstable for large number of nodes)
  - Lagrange bivariate (also uses a slow method for cardinal polynomials, does
    not yet interface well with the EI class)

* Example scripts for empirical interpolation and, method of fundamental
  solutions.

* A variety of unit tests have been implemented.

* A few of the different classes (Domain, Segment, Scattering) can plot some of
  their features using matplotlib.

* Restructured package layout (and changed name from emfs to empirical).

*  Initial version

What works:

* The examples/tut_scatt.py script is a port of the mpspack script of the same
  name. While it is slightly different in some ways, it does successfully
  calculate a plane wave scattering problem, and display the resultant fields.

* All of the unit tests written so far run successfully. However, there is only
  60% coverage with these, and even that is not a thorough coverage of all the
  methods called.
