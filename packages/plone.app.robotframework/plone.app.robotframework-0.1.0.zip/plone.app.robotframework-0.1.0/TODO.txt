Todo-List:

- Describe and document the two possible test runner approaches (asko's and
  godfroid's)
- Describe/investigate different ways of writing higher-level Plone keywords
  (standard robot vs. BDD, given-when-then)
- Write documentation for selenium2library keywords (tisto).
- Write documentation for Plone keywords. (Should we use robot framework tools
  to do this and then simply reference them? Ed)
- Write documentation about separating Keywords and Tests
  * What is the difference between a keyword and a test
  * Keywords should be for test setup or running, but should not themselves
    test things.  This way failures will be pointing to functionality and not
    be across multiple tests.

Wish List:

- Add support for jQuery like selectors in selenium
  (http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/wiki/jQueryElementSelectors
  https://github.com/rtomac/robotframework-selenium2library/issues/77)
