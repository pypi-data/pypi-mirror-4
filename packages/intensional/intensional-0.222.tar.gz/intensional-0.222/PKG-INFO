Description: Intensional (rule-defined) sets for Python.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        There are two ways of defining a set: intensional and extensional. Extensional
        sets like ``set([1,3,5,'daisy'])`` enumerate every member of the set explicitly.
        
        Intensional sets, in contrast, are defined by rules. For example "the set of all
        prime numbers" or "every word beginning with ``'a'`` and ending with ``'t'``.
        Intensional sets are often infinite. It may be possible to generate a list of
        their members, but it's not as simple as a "give me everything you've got!"
        ``for`` loop.
        
        Once you know what you're looking for, intensional sets are *everywhere*.
        Python doesn't represent them directly, but regular expressions, many list
        comprehensions, and all manner of testing and filtering operations are really
        faces of the intensional set concept. Many functions test whether something
        'qualifies'. ``os.path.isdir(d)`` for example, tests whether ``d`` is in the set
        of legitimate directories, and ``isinstance(s, str)`` tests whether ``s`` is a
        member of the set of ``str`` objects. Even the core ``if`` conditional can be
        construed as testing for membership in an intensional set--the set of all items
        that pass the test.
        
        Many such tests have a temporal aspect--they determine whether a value is a
        member *right now*. The answer may change in the future, if
        conditions change. Others tests are invariant over time. ``%%734`` will never be a
        valid Python identifier, no matter how many times it's tested--unless the rules
        of the overall Python universe change, that is.
        
        Intensional sets are part and parcel of all programming, even if they're not
        explicitly represented or called by that name.``intensional`` helps Python
        programs represent intensional sets directly.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        ``intensional`` defines several set ``IntensionalSet`` subclasses
        such as ``Any``, ``Every``, ``ButNot``,
        and ``EitherOr``. These correspond roughly to set operations union, intersection,
        difference, and symmetric difference (aka xor). Of these, ``Any`` is the most useful::
        
            from intensional import *
            
            name = 'Stephen'
            if name in Any('Steve', 'Steven', 'Stephen'):
                print 'Good name!'
        
        So far, there's nothing here you couldn't do with standard Python ``set`` data types.
        So let's broaden out to more generic intensional sets::
        
            if name in Test("x.startswith('S')"):
                print "Your name starts with S!"
        
        ``Test`` takes a lambda expression or string in its constructor. If it's a string, ``Test`` assumes
        the interesting variable name is ``x`` and compiles the string expression with an automatically provided
        ``lambda x:`` prefix. This makes code a bit terser and cleaner. Now the sets start getting more
        interesting.::
        
            starts_with_S =  Test("x.startswith('S')")
            ends_with_n   =  Test("x.endswith('n')")
            
            if name in Every(starts_with_S, ends_with_n):
                ...  # Stephen and Steven pass, but Steve does not
                
        Of course, this could also be rendered as::
            
            if name in Test("x.startswith('S') and x.endswith('n')"):
                ...  # Stephen and Steven pass, but Steve does not
                
        Or even::
        
            S_something_n = starts_with_S & ends_with_n
            if name in S_something_n:
                ...
        
        String Search
        =============
        
        ``intensional`` defines sets for regular expression (``Re``) and glob (``Glob``) string matching.
        For example::
        
            name = 'Stephen'
            if name in Re(r'\b(s\w*)\b', Re.I):
                print 'Good name, {}'.format(Re._[1])
        
        Note that this enables a form of (or alternative to) *en passant* assignment
        that shortens regular expression conditionals by at least one line
        compared to the standard ``re`` module. A spiffed-up version of the
        ``re.MatchObject`` is available at ``Re._``. This object can be
        indexed to get regexp match groups. For named groups (e.g. ``(?P<firstname>\w+)``),
        the matched value can be retrieved by attribute: ``Re._.firstname``. All of the
        other ``re.MatchObject`` methods and properties can also be accessed this way,
        such as ``Re._.start(1)`` and ``Re._.span(1)``.
        
        For simple matching, the ``Glob`` class (which plays by the rules
        of Unix glob expressions) may be simpler:
        
            if name in Glob('S*'):
                ...
            
        Type Membership
        ===============
        
        ::
        
            if x in Instances(int):
                ...
        
        is identical to::
        
            if isinstance(x, int):
               ...
               
        An alias ``IsInstance`` exists for ``Instances`` for cases where the singular construction is more linguistically natural.
        A second alias ``Type`` is also available.
        
        Set Operations
        ==============
        
        ``intensional`` supports some, but not all, of Python's classic ``set`` operations.
        There are two primary rules:
        
         *  ``IntensionalSet`` attempts to supports all of the ``collections.Set`` methods like
            ``union()`` and ``intersection()``. But ``IntensionalSet`` objects are immutable, so they do not support
            self-mutating operations like ``add()``, ``pop()``, and ``|=`` defined by
            ``collections.MutableSet``.
            
         *  Because they are defined by rules rather than explicit lists of members, it is
            not (in general) possible to determine the cardinality (i.e. ``len()``) of an ``IntensionalSet``,
            nor to iterate through all of its members, nor to test equality. ``IntensionalSet`` objects are
            used primarily for determining membership.
        
        Because of an implementation detail, ``IntensionalSet`` classes are parallel to,
        but are not true subclasses of, ``collections.Set``.
        
        Extensions
        ==========
        
        It's easy to define new ``IntensionalSet`` subclasses that define other kinds
        of logical tests in generalized, linguistically "clean" ways that make code
        more readable. As an example, the ``Instances`` intensional set is defined like this::
        
            class Instances(with_metaclass(MementoMetaclass, IntensionalSet)):
                """
                An object is in an IsInstance if it is an instance of the given types.
                """
                def __init__(self, *args):
                    self.types = tuple(args)
                    
                def __contains__(self, item):
                    return isinstance(item, self.types)
        
        ``__init__()`` simply remembers what arguments the set is constructed with,
        while ``__contains__()`` implements the test, answering: Does the given item belong in a set
        constructed with these arguments?
        
        The only complexity here is the ``with_metaclass(MementoMetaclass, IntensionalSet)`` phrase,
        which is simply a compatibility mechanism to be able to define a class in either
        Python 2 or Python 3 with a given metaclass.
        
        ``MementoMetaclass`` is used so that
        once constructed, a set object is fetched from cache rather than
        redundantly reconstructed if any subsequent mentions are made. This is a useful performance
        tweak. For regular expressions, for example, it allows the ``Re.__init__()`` set constructor
        to compile the regular expression just once, even if a program contains many mentions of
        ``Re(<some regular exprssion>)``. Even
        higher-performance is to assign constructed sets to a name/variable and refer to them
        via that name. This::
        
            integers = Instances(int)
            
            if x in integers:
                ...
        
        requires less work than::
        
            if x in Instances(int):
                ...
        
        and is preferred if the test is to be executed frequently. But this pre-naming is just a tweak, and
        not a requirement.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
         * Commenced automated multi-version testing with
           `pytest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_
           and `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_.
           
         * Now
           successfully packaged for, and tested against, all late-model versions
           of Python: 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3
           plus one (2.5) that isn't so very recent,
           and one (PyPy 1.9, based on Python 2.7.2) that is differently implemented.
           
         * ``intensional`` is just one facet of a larger project to rethink how items
           are tested for membership and/or chosen from collections. Stay tuned!

        Installation
        ============
        
        To install the latest version::
        
            pip install -U intensional
        
        To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::
        
            python3.3 -m easy_install --upgrade intensional
            
        (You may need to prefix these with "sudo " to authorize installation. If they're
        already installed, the ``--upgrade`` flag will be helpful; add it right before the
        package name.)
