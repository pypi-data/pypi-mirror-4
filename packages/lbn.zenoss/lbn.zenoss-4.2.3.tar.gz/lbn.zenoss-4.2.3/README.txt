lbn.zenoss
----------

Zenoss is still a decidedly arcane user of the Zope application server
environment and particularly in the adoption of extensible Component
Architecture concepts.

Also, the concept of a ZenPack is rather twisted and we're providing
infrastructure here to provide additional shims to treat these as
plain python eggs.

This package also contains the basis for efforts to deploy Zenoss using
buildout and friends.
