.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Adds new instances to the LoadBalancer.
.sp
Once the instance is registered, it starts receiving traffic and requests from
the LoadBalancer. Any instance that is not in any of the Availability Zones
registered for the LoadBalancer will be moved to the \fIOutOfService\fP state. It
will move to the \fIInService\fP state when the Availability Zone is added to the
LoadBalancer.
.IP Note
In order for this call to be successful, the client must have created the
LoadBalancer. The client must provide the same account credentials as those
that were used to create the LoadBalancer.
.RE
.IP Note
Completion of this API does not guarantee that operation has completed.
Rather, it means that the request has been registered and the changes will
happen shortly.

A list of instance IDs that should be registered with the LoadBalancer.
.IP Note
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
When the instance is stopped and then restarted, the IP addresses associated
with your instance changes. Elastic Load Balancing cannot recognize the new
IP address, which prevents it from routing traffic to your instances. We
recommend that you de\-register your Amazon EC2 instances from your load
balancer after you stop your instance, and then register the load balancer
with your instance after you\(aqve restarted. To de\-register your instances
from load balancer, use  deregister\-instances\-from\-load\-balancer action.
