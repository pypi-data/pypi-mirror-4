describe-stack-resources
************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns AWS resource descriptions for running and deleted stacks. If
"--stack-name" is specified, all the associated resources that are
part of the stack are returned. If "--physical-resource-id" is
specified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource
belongs to are returned.

Note: Only the first 100 resources will be returned. If your stack has
  more resources than this, you should use "list-stack-resources"
  instead.

For deleted stacks, "describe-stack-resources" returns resource
information for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

You must specify either "--stack-name" or "--physical-resource-id" ,
but not both. In addition, you can specify "--logical-resource-id" to
filter the returned result. For more information about resources, the
"--logical-resource-id" and "--physical-resource-id" , go to the AWS
CloudFormation User Guide .

Note: A "ValidationError" is returned if you specify both "--stack-name"
  and "--physical-resource-id" in the same request.


SYNOPSIS

     [--physical-resource-id <value>]
     [--logical-resource-id <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--stack-name"  (string)
   The name or the unique identifier associated with the stack.

   Required: Conditional. If you do not specify "--stack-name" , you
   must specify "--physical-resource-id" .

   Default: There is no default value.

"--physical-resource-id"  (string)
   The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical
   instance ID of a resource supported by AWS CloudFormation.

   For example, for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance,
   "--physical-resource-id" corresponds to the "InstanceId" . You can
   pass the EC2 "InstanceId" to "describe-stack-resources" to find
   which stack the instance belongs to and what other resources are
   part of the stack.

   Required: Conditional. If you do not specify "--physical-resource-
   id" , you must specify "--stack-name" .

   Default: There is no default value.

"--logical-resource-id"  (string)
   The logical name of the resource as specified in the template.

   Default: There is no default value.
