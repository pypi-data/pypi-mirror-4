The ``repoze.formapi`` provides a form library which integrates with
HTML forms instead of abstracting them away.

It provides a small framework to take you through the entire process
of rendering a form, provide default values, validate and execute form
actions.

Form fields are defined using Python base types which map out nested
data structures with end points that are either integers, strings,
floats or tuples of these. It's up to the application to bridge these
with more complex objects.
