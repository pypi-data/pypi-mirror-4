        Introdution
        ===========
        
        This recipe can be used to generate files for basic authentication of HTTP
        users, to restrict the access to HTTP resoruces. The aim is to be fully
        compatible with the `htpasswd program`_ that come with the
        `Apache httpd Server`_, and support all the `password formats`_ that it
        supports. This formats, with some minor diffenrences in the case of the plain
        method, are also `supported by the auth_basic module`_ of the nginx http server.
        
        At this moment this recipe support plain and crypt algorithms for storage
        passwords. The crypt algorithm is based on the system's crypt() routine, so it
        inherits its limitations (see: `man 5 crypt`_).
        
        
        *Note:* The plaintext passowrds are only accepted by the Apache httpd server on
        Windows and Netware.
        
        *Caution:* This recipe should not be used to update an existing htpasswd file,
        because it overwritte the htpasswd file in every update.
        
        Example usage
        =============
        
        The simplest way to use this recipe is to add a part in ``buildout.cfg`` like
        this:
        
        .. code-block:: ini
        
            [buildout]
            parts = htpasswd
        
            [htpasswd]
            recipe = collective.recipe.htpasswd
            output = ${buildout:directory}/etc/htpasswd
            credentials =
                nueces:secret
                nutz:crackme
        
        
        Supported options
        =================
        
        * output: Specify a path to the output file. The path will be created if it does
          not exist.
        * credentials: One set per line of credentials formed by username and password separated by a
          colon. e.g. <username>:<password>.
        * mode: Specified with octal numbers, as in the chmod program. e.g. 640. If it
          not set the file are created with the mask mode from the system enviroment.
        * algorithm: The supported options are 'crypt' and 'plain'. Default to 'cypt'.
