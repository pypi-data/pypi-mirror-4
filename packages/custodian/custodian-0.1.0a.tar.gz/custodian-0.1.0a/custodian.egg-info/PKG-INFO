Description: Custodian is a simple, robust and flexible just-in-time job management
        framework written in Python. Using custodian, you can create wrappers that
        perform error checking, job management and error recovery. It has a simple
        plugin framework that allows you to develop specific job management workflows
        for different applications.
        
        Custodian is now in an very early alpha. Use with care.
        
        Getting pymatgen
        ================
        
        Stable version
        --------------
        
        The version at the Python Package Index (PyPI) is always the latest stable
        release that will be hopefully, be relatively bug-free. The easiest way to
        install pymatgen on any system is to use easy_install or pip, as follows::
        
            easy_install custodian
        
        or::
        
            pip install custodian
        
        Some plugins (e.g., vasp management) require additional setup (please see
        `custodian's documentation <http://packages.python.org/custodian>`_).
        
        Developmental version
        ---------------------
        
        The bleeding edge developmental version is at the custodian's `Github repo
        <https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian>`_. The developmental
        version is likely to be more buggy, but may contain new features. The
        Github version include test files as well for complete unit testing. After
        cloning the source, you can type::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        or to install the package in developmental mode::
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        All required dependencies should be automatically taken care of if you
        install pymatgen using easy_install or pip. Otherwise, these packages should
        be available on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
        
        1. Python 2.7+ required. New default modules such as json are used, as well as
           new unittest features in Python 2.7.
        
        Optional dependencies
        ---------------------
        
        Optional libraries that are required if you need certain features:
        
        1. pymatgen 2.4.3+: To use the plugin for VASP.
        2. nose - For complete unittesting.
