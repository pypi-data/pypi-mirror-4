Introduction
============

Collections in Plone are the most powerful tool content editors and site
managers have to construct navigation and site sections.

This is a brand new implementation of collections for Plone, using
ajax/javascript to make a simpler, easier and streamlined user experience
for using collections. Having a more lightweight backend that does not depend
on many nested criteria types.

It's designed with simplicity and usability as a main focus, so content editors
and site managers can create complex search queries with ease.

.. note::

  This is the dexterity-based version of plone.app.collection. If you are
  looking for the ATContentTypes-based version that is included in Plone
  since version 4.2, stay with the 1.x branch of plone.app.collection.


How to add your own criteria to a collection
--------------------------------------------

plone.app.collection and (or more precisely the underlying
plone.app.querystring) uses plone.app.registry records to define possible
search criteria for a collection.

If you want to add your own criteria, say to choose a value from a custom
index, you have to create a plone.app.registry record for this index in your
generic setup profile (e.g profiles/default/registry.xml)::

    <registry>
      <records interface="plone.app.querystring.interfaces.IQueryField"
               prefix="plone.app.querystring.field.department">
        <value key="title">Department</value>
        <value key="description">A custom department index</value>
        <value key="enabled">True</value>
        <value key="sortable">False</value>
        <value key="operations">
            <element>plone.app.querystring.operation.string.is</element>
        </value>
        <value key="group">Metadata</value>
      </records>
    </registry>

The title-value refers to the custom index ("Department"), the operations-value
is used to filter the items and the group-value defines under which group the
entry shows up in the selection widget.
