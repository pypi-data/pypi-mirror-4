        ============================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `JavaScript Canvas to Blob`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`JavaScript Canvas to Blob`: https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Canvas-to-Blob
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.javascript_canvas_to_blob``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        -----------
        
        You can import ``canvas_to_blob`` from ``js.javascript_canvas_to_blob`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.javascript_canvas_to_blob import canvas_to_blob
          >>> canvas_to_blob.need()
