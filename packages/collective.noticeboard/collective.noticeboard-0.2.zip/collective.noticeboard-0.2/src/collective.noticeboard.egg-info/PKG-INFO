        ======================
        
        A fancy noticeboard for Plone inspired by corkboard.me
        
        This Plone-Addon allow suser to transform folders or collections into a fancy noticeboard where users can add and modify postit-like notes.
        Notes display the content of a content-type (by default News Items) and are editable in overlays.
        Notes are draggable, resizeable and can change color.
        
        In the configuration you can:
        
        - select the default type used for notes
        - select types that should be displayed
        - enable adding notes by clicking on the canvas
        - enable auto-publishing of notes
        - select if notes should be hidden when the were not updated for a number of days
        - display a link to a help-page
        
        Items that were excluded from the navigation are not shown on the noticeboard (you might want to exclude the help-page).
        
        collective.noticeboard works with Archetypes and Dexterity.
