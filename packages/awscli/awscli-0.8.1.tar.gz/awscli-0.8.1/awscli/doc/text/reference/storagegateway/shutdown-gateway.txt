shutdown-gateway
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation shuts down a gateway. To specify which gateway to shut
down, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of
your request.

The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the
storage gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the VM.

Note: If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first
  shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable
  conditions.

After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except
start-gateway ,  describe-gateway-information , and  list-gateways .
For more information, see  activate-gateway . Your applications cannot
read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no
snapshots taken.

Note: When you make a shutdown request, you will get a "200 OK" success
  response immediately. However, it might take some time for the
  gateway to shut down. You can call the  describe-gateway-information
  API to check the status. For more information, see  activate-gateway
  .

If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway
(using delete-gateway ) to no longer pay software charges associated
with the gateway.
