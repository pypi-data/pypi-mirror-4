mr.poe
======

mr.poe is a fork of Raven for Python 2.4 compatibility. Not all of the
contrib modules are fully convered, but the Zope one has been modified to give
useful messages for the Zope 2.10 era.

**Note**: This is just an updated distribution name, you cannot have both Raven and mr.poe installed in the same environment, so *please*, sandbox your apps.

Raven

Raven is a Python client for `Sentry <http://www.getsentry.com/>`_. It provides
full out-of-the-box support for many of the popular frameworks, including
Django, and Flask. Raven also includes drop-in support for any WSGI-compatible

Your application doesn't live on the web? No problem! Raven is easy to use in
any Python application.
