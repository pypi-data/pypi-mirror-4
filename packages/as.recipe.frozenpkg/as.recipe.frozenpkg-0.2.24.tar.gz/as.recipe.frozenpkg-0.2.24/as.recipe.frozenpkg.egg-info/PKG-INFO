        Introduction
        ============
        
        This recipe enables you to freeze your buildout in a RPM, tgz's, etc.
        You can specify the package details, the installation prefix, and the eggs and
        scripts that must be copied to the package.
        
        Only RPM packing is currently implemented.
        
        This recipe is EXPERIMENTAL and quite unstable, so use at your own risk...
