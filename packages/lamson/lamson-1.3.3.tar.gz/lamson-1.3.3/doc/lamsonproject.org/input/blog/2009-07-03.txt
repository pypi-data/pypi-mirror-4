Title:  Article In The Reg About Lamson (By Ted Dziuba)

Just a quick update to point people at an article in "The Register":http://www.theregister.co.uk/ by 
"Ted Dziuba":http://teddziuba.com/ entitled "Lamson - email app coding without the palm sweat: Doing what Java never did":http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/03/lamson/.  He interviewed me about Lamson, things I think you can use it for, and other fun stuffs.

A snippet from the article:  "As a development platform, e-mail has gone
neglected for decades. Its esoteric implementation details and specifications
are regarded by many in the IT business as voodoo, best left to old-granddad
programs like Sendmail or Postfix. Zed Shaw hopes to change that with his new
project, Lamson. (The name Lamson is a throwback to the early 20th century
pneumatic tubes used to shuttle messages between offices. It was
originally called Son of Sam, but Zed's dog convinced him to change
it)."

h2. 0.9.6 Coming Soon

I've been cranking on various projects with Lamson and haven't ran into too many other bugs.  I'll be
doing a code review of what's in the Bazaar repo and then pusing out a 0.9.6 probably this weekend.
