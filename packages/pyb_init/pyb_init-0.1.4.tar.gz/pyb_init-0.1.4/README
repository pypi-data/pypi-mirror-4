pyb\_init

`|Build Status| <https://travis-ci.org/mriehl/pyb_init>`_

Short script to ease working with the awesome pybuilder.

What it does
============

When using the `pybuilder <http://pybuilder.github.com>`_, every project
needs to be initialized. After checking out the project, you need to

-  Create a virtual environment.
-  Activate the virtual environment.
-  Install the pybuilder in the virtual environment.
-  Install the project dependencies in the virtual environment.
-  Run pyb to build and test your project.

This program is an attempt at making these routine operations dead
simple and time-efficient.
