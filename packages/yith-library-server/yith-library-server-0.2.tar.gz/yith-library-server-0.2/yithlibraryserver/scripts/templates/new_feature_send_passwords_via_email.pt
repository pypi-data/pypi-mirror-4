<p>Hi ${user.first_name}</p>

<p>We are proud to announce a new feature of Yith Library: periodic email backups directly delivered to your inbox!</p>

<p>With this feature you will receive a copy of your passwords collection in your email once a month.</p>

<p>We have enabled this feature by default but if you don't like it you can disable it in your preferences at <a href="${preferences_link}">${preferences_link}</a></p>

<p>- The Yith Library team</p>
