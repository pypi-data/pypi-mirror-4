Description: Nagios has been around for quite some time, but producing output it can 
        consume is something of a black art. Only the plugin documentation 
        actually explains what all the extra semicolons or extended formatting 
        even means.
        
        This is especially onerous when performance consuming add-ons expect a 
        specific structure before operating properly. This package strives to 
        greatly simplify the process of actually generating Nagios output using 
        Python.
        
        Please see the TODO file for a very rudimentary roadmap for this
        project! Development should pick up after the move to github thanks
        to the increase in volunteers.
