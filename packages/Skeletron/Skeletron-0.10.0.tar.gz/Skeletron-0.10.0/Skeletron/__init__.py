""" Linework generalizer for use on maps.

Skeletron generalizes collections of lines to a specific spherical mercator
zoom level and pixel precision, using a polygon buffer and voronoi diagram as
described in a 1996 paper by Alnoor Ladak and Roberto B. Martinez, "Automated
Derivation of High Accuracy Road Centrelines Thiessen Polygons Technique"
(http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc96/TO400/PAP370/P370.HTM).

Required dependencies:
  - qhull binary (http://www.qhull.org)
  - shapely (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely)
  - pyproj (http://code.google.com/p/pyproj)
  - networkx (http://networkx.lanl.gov)

You'd typically use it via one of the provided utility scripts, currently
just these three:

skeletron-generalize.py

  Accepts GeoJSON input and generates GeoJSON output.

skeletron-osm-streets.py

  Accepts OpenStreetMap XML input and generates GeoJSON output for streets
  using the "name" and "highway" tags to group collections of ways.

skeletron-osm-route-rels.py

  Accepts OpenStreetMap XML input and generates GeoJSON output for routes
  using the "network", "ref" and "modifier" tags to group relations.
