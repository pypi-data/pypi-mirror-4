        Introduction
        ------------
        
        `collective.flag` is a simple package that adds an option of marking special
        objects in a Plone site |---| flagging them. An additional field added to the
        ``Settings`` schemata can be used to differentiate regular documents from the
        special ones. Possible use-cases:
        
        * Put items to the frontpage. Usually not every most recent item should go
          to the frontpage, but those having a special meaning;
        
        * Allow to search for items that are special when building a ``Collection``.

        Rename the field's title
        ========================
        
        There is not easy way of renaming field's title using a controlpanel or
        something like that. What you can do instead |---| translate the title using
        standard mechanisms of Plone.
        
        The recommended solution is to override the translation for the
        ``label_flaggedobject_title`` msgid in the ``collective.flag`` domain. Read
        more about how to do this in Plone 3.x or later here |---| `i18n, locales and
        Plone 3.0`__.
