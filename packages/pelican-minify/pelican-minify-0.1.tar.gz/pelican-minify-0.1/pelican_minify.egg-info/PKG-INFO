Description: # pelican-minify
        
        An HTML minification plugin for
        [Pelican](http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), the static site generator.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        To install the library, you can use
        [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/).
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install pelican-minify
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use `pelican-minify`, you need to make only a single change to your
        `pelicanconf.py` file (the configuration file that Pelican uses to generate
        your static site.
        
        Update your `PLUGINS` global, and append `minify` to the list, eg:
        
        ``` python
        # pelicanconf.py
        
        # ...
        
        PLUGINS = [
            # ...
            'minify',
            # ...
        ]
        
        # ...
        ```
        
        The next time you build your Pelican site, `pelican-minify` will automatically
        minify your Pelican pages after they've been generated.
        
        This reduces file size and obscures the public source code, but keep in
        mind--minifying your static site will increase your Pelican build times, as it
        adds extra file processing for each page generated.
