create-access-key
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new AWS Secret Access Key and corresponding AWS Access Key
ID for the specified user. The default status for new keys is "Active"
.

If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name
implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID signing the request. Because
this action works for access keys under the AWS account, you can use
this API to manage root credentials even if the AWS account has no
associated users.

For information about limits on the number of keys you can create, see
Limitations on IAM Entities in *Using AWS Identity and Access
Management* .

Warning: To ensure the security of your AWS account, the Secret Access Key is
  accessible only during key and user creation. You must save the key
  (for example, in a text file) if you want to be able to access it
  again. If a secret key is lost, you can delete the access keys for
  the associated user and then create new keys.
