    """Base class required for all Muntjac applications. This class provides
    all the basic services required by Muntjac. These services allow external
    discovery and manipulation of the user, L{com.vaadin.ui.Window windows} and
    themes, and starting and stopping the application.

    As mentioned, all Muntjac applications must inherit this class. However,
    this is almost all of what one needs to do to create a fully functional
    application. The only thing a class inheriting the C{Application}
    needs to do is implement the C{init} method where it creates the
    windows it needs to perform its function. Note that all applications must
    have at least one window: the main window. The first unnamed window
    constructed by an application automatically becomes the main window which
    behaves just like other windows with one exception: when accessing windows
    using URLs the main window corresponds to the application URL whereas other
    windows correspond to a URL gotten by catenating the window's name to the
    application URL.

    See the class C{muntjac.demo.HelloWorld} for a simple example of
    a fully working application.

    B{Window access.} C{Application} provides methods to
    list, add and remove the windows it contains.

    B{Execution control.} This class includes method to start and finish the
    execution of the application. Being finished means basically that no
    windows will be available from the application anymore.

    B{Theme selection.} The theme selection process allows a theme to be
    specified at three different levels. When a window's theme needs to be
    found out, the window itself is queried for a preferred theme. If the
    window does not prefer a specific theme, the application containing the
    window is queried. If neither the application prefers a theme, the default
    theme for the L{terminal<muntjac.terminal.terminal.ITerminal>} is used. The
    terminal always defines a default theme.

        """Gets a window by name. Returns C{None} if the application is
        not running or it does not contain a window corresponding to the name.

        All windows can be referenced by their names in url
        C{http://host:port/foo/bar/} where
        C{http://host:port/foo/} is the application url as returned by
        getURL() and C{bar} is the name of the window.

        One should note that this method can, as a side effect create new
        windows if needed by the application. This can be achieved by
        overriding the default implementation.

        If for some reason user opens another window with same url that is
        already open, name is modified by adding "_12345678" postfix to the
        name, where 12345678 is a random number. One can decide to create
        another window-object for those windows (recommended) or to discard
        the postfix. If the user has two browser windows pointing to the same
        window-object on server, synchronization errors are likely to occur.

        If no browser-level windowing is used, all defaults are fine and this
        method can be left as is. In case browser-level windows are needed, it
        is recommended to create new window-objects on this method from their
        names if the super.getWindow() does not find existing windows. See
        below for implementation example::

                # If we already have the requested window, use it
