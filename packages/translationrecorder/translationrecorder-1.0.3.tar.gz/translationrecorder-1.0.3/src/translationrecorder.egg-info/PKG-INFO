Description: Overview
        --------
        
        The recorder is attached to an existing translation function keeps
        track of the inputs and outputs.
        
        The result is a *locales* directory structure::
        
          <domain>.pot
          <lang>/
          <lang>/LC_MESSAGES
          <lang>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.po
          ...
        
        This structure is written on process exit.
        
        Note that when the recorder is initialized, it imports any existing
        message catalog. That is, it's robust to process startup/shutdown and
        can operate continuously.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In Python-code, enable the translation recorder by wrapping an
        existing translation function.
        
        The easiest way to wire this up is by patching the module that holds
        the function (if possible)::
        
        
          import zope.i18n
          import translationrecorder
        
          # Patch Zope's translation function
          zope.i18n.translate = translationrecorder.Recorder(
              zope.i18n.translate, './locales'
              )
        
        
        Framework Integration
        ---------------------
        
        There's integration included for the Pyramid and Zope/Plone
        frameworks.
        
        Set the environment variable ``RECORD_TRANSLATIONS`` to an existing
        *locales* directory and run your server process::
        
          $ mkdir ./locales
          $ RECORD_TRANSLATIONS=./locales bin/paster serve ...
        
        This requires that the `translationrecorder` module is imported. This
        is handled automatically on Plone. For other systems::
        
          import translationrecorder
        
        Technically, the package applies patches against the global
        translation functions of the applicable frameworks.

        Changes
        =======
        
        1.0.3 (2012-10-17)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed an issue where a translation would always appear with a
          default text, even when not present in catalog.
        
        - Fixed an issue where a message with a mapping would not get properly
          decoded into a message id.
        
        1.0.2 (2012-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where a quote appearing in a message id or translation
          would corrupt on save.
        
        1.0.1 (2012-01-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed issue where generated .po-files would result in a syntax error
          on compilation using ``pythongettext`` due to a missing initial
          dummy message translation.
        
        - Patch the translation domain instead of the (higher-level)
          global translation function.
        
          This fixes an issue where messages would not be recorded with the
          proper translation domain and the used target languages would not be
          correctly registered.
        
        1.0 (2011-11-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial public release.
