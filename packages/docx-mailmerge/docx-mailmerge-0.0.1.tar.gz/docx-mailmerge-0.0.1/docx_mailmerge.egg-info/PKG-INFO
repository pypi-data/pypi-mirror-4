Description: ===============
        docx Mail Merge
        ===============
        
        Installation with ``pip``:
        ::
        
            $ pip install docx-mailmerge
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Read the file.
        ::
        
            from mailmerge import MailMerge
            document = MailMerge('input.docx')
        
        
        List all merge fields.
        ::
        
            print document.get_merge_fields()
        
        
        Merge fields, supplied as kwargs.
        ::
        
            document.merge(field1='docx Mail Merge',
                           field2='Can be used for merging docx documents')
        
        Write document to file. This should be a new file, as ``ZipFile`` cannot modify
        existing zip files.
        ::
        
            document.write('output.docx')
        
        
        Todo / Wish List
        ================
        
        * Make it easier to work with repeating blocks. This is currently supported,
          but somewhat cumbersome to work with.
        * Preserve formatting of the merge field, currently it defaults to the
          formatting of the containing text.
        * Image merging.
