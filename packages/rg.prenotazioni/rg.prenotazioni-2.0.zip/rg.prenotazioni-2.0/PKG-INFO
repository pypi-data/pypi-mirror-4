        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product introduces two new contents to your Plone site:
        
        - `Booking Folder`_
        - `Booking`_
        
        Booking Folder
        --------------
        
        Is a folderish content type that will store your reservations (the content type `Booking`_).

        How to use
        ==========
        
        After adding a Booking, non managers users see that the slot is busy, managers 
        see in the slot who made the request, a link to the Booking detail and a link to 
        move the Booking.
        
        Managers can confirm a Booking using workflow transitions. 
        The workflow transition triggers an email to be sent to the booker (see below).
        
        Content Rules (mail notifications)
        ==================================
        
        There are additional content rules that can be used to notify booking owner when his booking has been accepted
        or re-scheduled.
        
        Rules are automatically created and enabled. See the Rule control panel to change settings.
        
        There's also a rule that can warn the Booking Folder responsible when new booking are created, but you need to
        manually enable it on folders. 
        
        Installation
