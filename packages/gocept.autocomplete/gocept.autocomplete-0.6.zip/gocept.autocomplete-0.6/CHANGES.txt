Changes
=======

0.6 (2013-04-23)
----------------

- Switch to jQuery UI and Fanstatic instead of YUI and zc.resourcelibrary.


0.5 (2011-01-11)
----------------

- `configure.zcml` no longer includes ``zope.app.zcmlfiles``, it was moved
  to `ftesting.zcml`.

- Described the dependency on ``zc.resourcelibrary`` in README which makes
  this package incompatible with packages using ``hurry.resource``.


0.4 (2010-06-17)
----------------

contributed by Roman Joost <roman@mooball.com>:

- Added grouped forms support.

- Added configuration options for delimiter character, minium query length and
  the type-ahed feature


0.3 (2010-02-26)
----------------

- Slightly different way to "estimate" the widget URL: use the form's context,
  not the getContent() method: if the content is redirected using an adapter
  then the view might not exist there.

0.2 (2009-02-23)
----------------

- register the widget for IChoice fields with an ISearchableSource.
  This functionality depends on z3c.form>=r96460 (will be included in
  z3c.form-2.0).
- improved documentation.

0.1 (2009-02-06)
----------------

- first release
- NOTE: still missing security declarations on the autocomplete-search view.
  This means anyone can query the source for values.
