Description: Hovercraft!
        ===========
        
        *The merge of convenience and cool!*
        
        Hovercraft! is a tool to make impress.js_ presentations from
        reStructuredText. For a quick explanation, see the demo_.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Write your presentations in a text markup language. No slow, limiting GUI, no annoying HTML!
        
        * Pan, rotate and zoom in 3D, with automatic repositioning of slides!
        
        * A presenter console with notes and slide previews!
        
        * The slide show generated is in HTML, so you only need a web browser to show it.
        
        * Easy sharing, as it can be put up on a website for anyone to see!
        
        Full documentation is available at readthedocs.org_, and also in the
        documentation subdirectory.
