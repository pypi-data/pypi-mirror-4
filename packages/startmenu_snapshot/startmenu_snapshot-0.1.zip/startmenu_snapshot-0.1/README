Start Menu Snapshot
Robert Steed 2012

This script recreates the winxp startmenu from the directory contents of 'All users'/startmenu 
and $userprofile$/startmenu. It can save the structure and the program icons to a pickled file
and later reload from the file. So this is mostly useful for remembering which programs that 
you had installed on another computer and how your start menu looked.
