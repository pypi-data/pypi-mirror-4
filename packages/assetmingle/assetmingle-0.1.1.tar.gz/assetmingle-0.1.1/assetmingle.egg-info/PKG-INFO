Description: assetmingle
        ===========
        
        Easily mingle your images with your HTML/CSS!
        
        This tool replaces image assets included in HTML and CSS files with [Data URLs][1], reducing the number of requests needed to load a page. It's useful for small images used on a page; GIFs, PNGs, small sprites, etc.
        
        Assetmingle is designed to be part of your deployment tools keychain. It looks for assets with the '#mingle' anchor as part of their URL, which means you can happily continue to work in a development environment and just "compile" the resulting CSS when you're ready to deploy. Hooray!

        Installation
        ============
        
            python ./setup.py install
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Just add #mingle to the end of the URLs to the image assets in your CSS or HTML like so:
        
            body
            {
                background: url('/images/small_background.png#mingle');
            }
        
        And then run:
        
            assetmingle main.css
        
        Assuming the 'images' directory is in the same place as main.css is, then your CSS will be changed to:
            
            body
            {
                background: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAA...');
            }
        
        That's it!
        
        Example Deployment Use
        ======================
        
        I usually use assetmingle in a deployment step. I love [Fabric][2], so the following is an example of a task that I use frequently in projects where I also have some sort of deploy step:
        
            @task
            def mingle_css():
                local('assetmingle -o --root=app/static app/static/css/main.css > app/static/css/main.final.css')
        
        The -o option outputs the new CSS to standard out and --root defines where the images directory lives

        Documentation
        =============
        
            Usage: assetmingle [-hvo] [--root=<path>] [INPUT ...]
        
            Options:
                -root=<path> The directory where your images or assets can be referenced from.
                -o           Output everything to standard out
                -h --help    Show this screen.
                -v           Be verbose.
