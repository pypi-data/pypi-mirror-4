        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Obviel`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Obviel`: http://www.obviel.org
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.obviel``) are published to some URL.
        
        Libraries
        =========
        
        You can the following resources from ``js.obviel``:
        
        * ``obviel`` (``obviel.js``)
        
        * ``obviel_template`` (``obviel-template.js``). Obviel currently
          includes this automatically (along with ``json_template`` and
          ``i18n``).
        
        * ``forms`` (``obviel-forms.js``)
        
        * ``forms_datepicker`` (``obviel-forms-datepicker.js``)
        
        * ``forms_autocomplete`` (``obviel-forms-autocomplete``)
        
        * ``forms_i18n`` (``obviel-forms.i18n``)
        
        * ``forms_nl`` (``obviel-forms-nl.js``)
        
        * ``patterns`` (``obviel-patterns.js``)
        
        * ``jgrowl`` (``obviel-jgrowl.js``)
        
        * ``i18n`` (``obviel-i18n.js``)
        
        * ``traject`` (``obviel-traject.js``)
         
        * ``sync`` (``obviel-sync.js``)
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        1.0b4-1 (2013-01-10)
        ====================
        
        - Fix the way package data is installed; rely on MANIFEST.in
          information only. Previously non-js files were not included, and
          these are needed for forms i18n support.
        
        1.0b4 (2013-01-09)
        ==================
        
        - Packaged Obviel 1.0b4.
        
        - Improve dependencies for ``obviel``, ``obviel_template``, ``forms``,
          ``sync``.
        
        - Add ``traject``, ``i18n``, ``forms_i18n`` resources.
        
        - Improve sync dependencies, but not right yet: need to package jshashtable
          and jshashset first.
        
        1.0b3 (2012-12-17)
        ==================
        
        - Packaged Obviel 1.0b3
        
        0.11.1 (2012-01-14)
        ===================
        
        - Fix translation domain.
        
        - My mistake, 0.11-1 did work. Ignore any previous evidence you ever saw of 0.11.1
          before now.
        
        0.11-1 (2012-01-13)
        ===================
        
        - Something in distutils/setuptools/distribute doesn't like the
          'resources' directory being symlinked, it just doesn't see it. As a
          result this never was in the 0.11 release. Try again hacking a real
          resources directory into existence temporarily for this release.
        
        0.11 (2012-01-13)
        =================
        
        - Initial release.
