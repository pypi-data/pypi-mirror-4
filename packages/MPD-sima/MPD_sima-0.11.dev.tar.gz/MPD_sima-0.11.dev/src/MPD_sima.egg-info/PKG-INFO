Description: 
        MPD_Sima is a Python script meant to feed your MPD playlist with tracks
        from artists similar to your currently playing track, provided that these
        artists are found in MPD library. Similar artists are fetched from last.fm.
        
        MPD_sima can queue track, top track or whole album for similar artists.
        
        This client allows you to never run out of music when your playlist
        queue is getting short.
