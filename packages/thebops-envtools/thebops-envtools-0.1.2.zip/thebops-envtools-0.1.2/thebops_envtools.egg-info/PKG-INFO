        THeBoPS-envtools - Tools for environment variables
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~---~~~~~-----~~~------------------
        
        Contains some tools related to environment variables:
        
        py-env
          Tell about environment variables which are used by the Python interpreter or
          certain Python software
        
        
        "Coming soon"
        -------------
        
        The following tools need some work because it won't work (cross-platform) to
        add their current form as scripts to the setup; they will follow soon:
        
        scanpath
          Find programs in a PATH, similar to the "which" command (which is not present
          on Windows(tm) systems).
        
        listpath
          List the PATH (or a PATH-like variable)
        
        modpath
          inserts, deletes, checks ... entries of a PATH-like variable.
          Since a Python program is run in a new process, it can't change the value of
          an environment variable directly; thus it must be wrapped using a shell
          function (*X) or a batch script (Windows).
