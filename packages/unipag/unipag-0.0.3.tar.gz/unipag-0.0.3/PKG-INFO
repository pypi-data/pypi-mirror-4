Description: Unipag Client for Python
        ========================
        
        .. image:: https://travis-ci.org/unipag/unipag-python.png?branch=master
                :target: https://travis-ci.org/unipag/unipag-python
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python version 2.6 or 2.7, or PyPy. For better security, we recommend to
        install `Python Requests`_ library, since it supports SSL certs verification.
        To install Requests, simply run: ::
        
            $ pip install requests
        
        or using easy_install: ::
        
            $ easy_install requests
        
        Requests library is optional. If it is not installed, Unipag Client will use
        urllib2 instead. All features of Unipag Client will remain fully functional, but
        it will not verify SSL certificate of Unipag API.

        Installation
        ------------

        or using easy_install: ::
        
            $ easy_install unipag
