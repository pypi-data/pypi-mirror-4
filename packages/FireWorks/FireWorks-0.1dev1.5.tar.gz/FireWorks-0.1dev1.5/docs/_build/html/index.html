<p><em>Note: FireWorks is under active development; major features are yet to be implemented, and the internal code is refactored often and not suitable for production. However, certain components of the code are available for initial testing.</em></p>
<p>FireWorks is a code for defining, managing, and executing scientific workflows. It can be used to automate most types of calculations over arbitrary computing resources, including those that have a queueing system.</p>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h1>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>FireWorks is intended to be a friendly workflow software that is easy to get started with, but flexible enough to handle complicated use cases.</p>
<p>Some (but not all) of its features include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Storage and management of workflows through MongoDB, a noSQL datastore that is flexible and easy to use.</li>
<li>Ability to distribute calculations over multiple worker nodes, each of which might use different a queueing system and process a different type of calculation.</li>
<li>Support for <em>dynamic</em> workflows that that react to results programmatically.  You can pre-specify what actions to take depending on the output of a job (e.g., terminate a workflow, add a new step, or completely alter the workflow)</li>
<li>Automatic detection of duplicate sub-workflows - skip duplicated portions between two workflows while still running unique sections</li>
<li>Loosely-coupled and modular infrastructure that is intentionally hackable. Use some FireWorks components without using <em>everything</em>, and more easily adapt FireWorks to your application.</li>
<li>Plug-and-play on several large supercomputing clusters and queueing systems <em>(future)</em></li>
<li>Monitoring of workflows through a web service <em>(future)</em></li>
<li>Package many small jobs into a single large job (useful for running on HPC machines that prefer a small number of large-CPU jobs). <em>(future)</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="limitations">
<h1>Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Some limitations of FireWorks include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>FireWorks has not been stress-tested to very large numbers of worker nodes. (If you try this, we&#8217;d love to hear the results!)</li>
<li>FireWorks has not been stress-tested to hundreds or thousands of jobs in a workflow. (If you try this, we&#8217;d love to hear the results!)</li>
<li>FireWorks does not automatically optimize the distribution of computing tasks over worker nodes (e.g., to minimize data movement or to match jobs to appropriate hardware); you must define such optimizations yourself.</li>
<li>FireWorks has only been tested on Linux and Macintosh machines. (If you are trying to get set up on Windows, please let us know if you encounter problems)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-fireworks-for-me">
<h1>Is FireWorks for me?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-fireworks-for-me" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It can be time-consuming to evaluate whether a workflow software will meet your computing needs from documentation alone. If you just want to know whether FireWorks is a potential solution to your workflow problem, one option is to e-mail a description of your problem to the developer at: <img alt="developer contact" class="align-bottom" src="_images/mail.png" /></p>
<p>We can tell you if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your problem is a great match for FireWorks</li>
<li>Your problem requires implementing minor extensions or modifications to FireWorks, but FireWorks is still a potential solution</li>
<li>Your problem is not easily solved with FireWorks and you should probably look elsewhere!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h1>Getting Started!<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To get started with FireWorks, we suggest that you follow our core tutorials. These tutorials will set up a central server as well as worker computers. They will also demonstrate how to define and run basic workflows. We expect that completing all of the core tutorials will take between one and three hours. (You might want to get a snack...)</p>

<div class="section" id="contributors">
<h1>Contributors<a class="headerlink" href="#contributors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>FireWorks was developed primarily by Anubhav Jain at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, using research funding from Kristin Persson for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.materialsproject.org">Materials Project</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Kocher and Dan Gunter initiated the architecture of a central database with multiple workers that queued &#8216;placeholder&#8217; scripts responsible for checking out jobs. Some of Michael&#8217;s code was refashioned for the QueueLauncher and the PBS QueueAdapter.</p>
<p>Shyue Ping Ong was extremely helpful in providing guidance and feedback, as well as the nitty gritty of getting set up with Sphinx documentation, PyPI, continuous integration, etc. The code for modifying a FireWork specification using a dictionary (DictMod) was adapted (with permission) from his <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/custodian">custodian</a> library. Incidentally, that library is a nice complement to FireWorks for use in FireTasks. Also, if you are in the market for a free Python materials analysis code, I highly recommend his <a class="reference external" href="http://packages.python.org/pymatgen/">pymatgen</a> library (which I also sometimes contribute to).</p>
<p>Wei Chen was the first test pilot of FireWorks, and contributed greatly to improving the docs and ensuring that FireWorks installation went smoothly for others. In addition, he made many suggestions to improve the usability of the code.</p>
