        Need to daemonize your Python2.7 projects? Matt Daemon has you covered.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - superuser (root) enforcement. Your script either requires it or it doesn't. You choose!
        
          -  If these checks fail, the script will exit with a status of **1**.
        
        - Uses the double-fork magic of UNIX to daemonize.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        - `Python`_ 2.7
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        - This is designed for CLI scripts, because it decouples from the parent environment and all.
        - Includes annoying messages when you use root to run a script.
        - ``daemon.start()`` and ``daemon.stop()`` don't print messages. You'll have to decide what to print, if anything.
        - MIT Licensed code, so you're free to do whatever you want with this. Sell it, steal it, improve it, anything at all!
        
        Running / Usage
        ---------------
        
        - Add the script to your dependencies, it's on pypi! (`pip install mattdaemon`)
        - See the example files on the `git repo`_ for usage.
