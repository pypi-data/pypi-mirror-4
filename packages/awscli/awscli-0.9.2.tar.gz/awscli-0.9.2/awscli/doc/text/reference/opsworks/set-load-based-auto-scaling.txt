set-load-based-auto-scaling
***************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Specify the load-based auto scaling configuration for a specified
layer.

Note: To use load-based auto scaling, you must create a set of load-based
  auto scaling instances. Load-based auto scaling operates only on the
  instances from that set, so you must ensure that you have created
  enough instances to handle the maximum anticipated load.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws opsworks set-load-based-auto-scaling
     --layer-id <value>
     [--down-scaling <value>]
     [--enable ]
     [--up-scaling <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--layer-id"  (string)
   The layer ID.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--down-scaling"  (structure)
   An "AutoScalingThresholds" object with the downscaling threshold
   configuration. If the load falls below these thresholds for a
   specified amount of time, OpsWorks stops a specified number of
   instances.

   "instance_count"  (integer)
      The number of instances to add or remove when the load exceeds a
      threshold.

   "load_threshold"  (double)
      The load threshold. For more information about how load is
      computed, see Load (computing) .

   "thresholds_wait_time"  (integer)
      The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed a
      threshold before more instances are added or removed.

   "ignore_metrics_time"  (integer)
      The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event occurs
      that OpsWorks should ignore metrics and not raise any additional
      scaling events. For example, OpsWorks adds new instances
      following an upscaling event but the instances won't start
      reducing the load until they have been booted and configured.
      There is no point in raising additional scaling events during
      that operation, which typically takes several minutes.
      "IgnoreMetricsTime" allows you to direct OpsWorks to not raise
      any scaling events long enough to get the new instances online.

   "memory_threshold"  (double)
      The memory utilization threshold, as a percent of the available
      memory.

   "cpu_threshold"  (double)
      The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the available
      CPU.

"--enable"  (boolean)
   Enables load-based auto scaling for the layer.

"--up-scaling"  (structure)
   An "AutoScalingThresholds" object with the upscaling threshold
   configuration. If the load exceeds these thresholds for a specified
   amount of time, OpsWorks starts a specified number of instances.

   "instance_count"  (integer)
      The number of instances to add or remove when the load exceeds a
      threshold.

      The load threshold. For more information about how load is
      computed, see Load (computing) .
