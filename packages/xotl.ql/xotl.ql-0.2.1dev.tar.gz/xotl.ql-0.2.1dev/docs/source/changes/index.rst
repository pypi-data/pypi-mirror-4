=============================
Index of the change proposals
=============================

This page contains changes proposals that *might* have an impact in the
external API (i.e, the API of the expression language and the those that are
directly or indirectly accesible from a :term:`query object`; this is the API
on which :term:`query translators <query translator>` depends).

The objective of this index is to record all the proposals (or mumblings) as
they may be introduced or not into this package. We believe this will help
clarify some of the rationale about the design decisions that have been made.
