create-app-cookie-stickiness-policy
***********************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that
follow that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be
associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.

This policy is similar to the policy created by
CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy, except that the lifetime of the
special Elastic Load Balancing cookie follows the lifetime of the
application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration.
The LoadBalancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the
application response includes a new application cookie.

If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the
session stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

Note: An application client must receive and send two cookies: the
  application-generated cookie and the special Elastic Load Balancing
  cookie named "AWSELB" . This is the default behavior for many common
  web browsers.
