Description: This module provides a function to calculate tripcodes:
        
            >>> from tripcode import tripcode
            >>> tripcode('tea')
            'WokonZwxw2'
            >>> tripcode(u'ｋａｍｉ')
            'yGAhoNiShI'
        
        It's notable only in that it also provides a (slow) pure-Python ``crypt(3)``
        implementation, which it uses as a fall-back on platforms that don't have
        one of their own (e.g. Windows):
        
           >>> from tripcode import _crypt
           >>> _crypt('encrapt', 'xy')
           'xyk2vcIZuU2vU'
