Description: #django-singleactiveobject
        
        Model mixin that ensures there is only one active model instance in your database. 
        
        ## What is this app good for?
        This might come in handy if you store some sort of configuration in your database
        but want to be sure there is only one active entry at a time.
        
        ## How it works
        
        Upon save() this will check if the current object is active=True and will set
        any other active object to active=False ensuring there is only one active.
        
        ## Download/Install
        
        ### using pip
        
        	pip install django-singleactiveobject
        	
        ### github
        
        	git clone https://github.com/byteweaver/django-singleactiveobject
          
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from singleactiveobject.models import SingleActiveObjectMixin
        
        class YourModel(SingleActiveObjectMixin):
          ...your stuff
        ```
        
        ## Testing
