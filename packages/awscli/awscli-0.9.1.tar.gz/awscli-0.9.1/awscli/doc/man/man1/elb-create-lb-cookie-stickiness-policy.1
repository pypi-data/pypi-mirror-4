.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled by the
lifetime of the browser (user\-agent) or a specified expiration period. This
policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.
.sp
When a LoadBalancer implements this policy, the LoadBalancer uses a special
cookie to track the backend server instance for each request. When the
LoadBalancer receives a request, it first checks to see if this cookie is
present in the request. If so, the LoadBalancer sends the request to the
application server specified in the cookie. If not, the LoadBalancer sends the
request to a server that is chosen based on the existing load balancing
algorithm.
.sp
A cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests from the
same user to that server. The validity of the cookie is based on the cookie
expiration time, which is specified in the policy configuration.
