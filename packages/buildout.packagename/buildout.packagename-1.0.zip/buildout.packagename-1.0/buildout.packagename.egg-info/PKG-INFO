Description: 
        ``buildout.packagename`` is a `zc.buildout`_ extension which can be used
        to extract the package name of an adjacent ``setup.py`` to avoid redundancy.
        The extracted name is made available via the ``package-name`` variable in
        the ``[buildout]`` section, i.e. as ``${buildout:package-name}``.
        
        .. _`zc.buildout`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        An example ``buildout.cfg`` using the extension might look like this::
        
          [buildout]
          extensions = buildout.packagename
          parts = app
          
          [app]
          recipe = zc.recipe.egg
          interpreter = app
          eggs = ${buildout:package-name}
        
        Please note that since using this extension only makes sense for
        package-specific buildouts, the `develop` setting is set to "."
        for added convenience.
