Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Collections in Plone are the most powerful tool content editors and site
        managers have to construct navigation and site sections.
        
        This is a brand new implementation of collections for Plone, using
        ajax/javascript to make a simpler, easier and streamlined user experience
        for using collections. Having a more lightweight backend that does not depend
        on many nested criteria types.
        
        It's designed with simplicity and usability as a main focus, so content editors
        and site managers can create complex search queries with ease.
        
        .. note::
        
          This is the dexterity-based version of plone.app.collection. If you are
          looking for the ATContentTypes-based version that is included in Plone
          since version 4.2, stay with the 1.x branch of plone.app.collection.
        
        
        How to add your own criteria to a collection
        --------------------------------------------
        
        plone.app.collection and (or more precisely the underlying
        plone.app.querystring) uses plone.app.registry records to define possible
        search criteria for a collection.
        
        If you want to add your own criteria, say to choose a value from a custom
        index, you have to create a plone.app.registry record for this index in your
        generic setup profile (e.g profiles/default/registry.xml)::
        
            <registry>
              <records interface="plone.app.querystring.interfaces.IQueryField"
                       prefix="plone.app.querystring.field.department">
                <value key="title">Department</value>
                <value key="description">A custom department index</value>
                <value key="enabled">True</value>
                <value key="sortable">False</value>
                <value key="operations">
                    <element>plone.app.querystring.operation.string.is</element>
                </value>
                <value key="group">Metadata</value>
              </records>
            </registry>
        
        The title-value refers to the custom index ("Department"), the operations-value
        is used to filter the items and the group-value defines under which group the
        entry shows up in the selection widget.

        ------------------
        
        - Check if item isPrincipiaFolderish instead of the hardcoded portal_type
          Folder when searching for images
          [ichimdav]
        
        - Fix thumbnail_view so it works with any portal_atct image types not just
          with Image and News Items
          [ichimdav]
        
        - Fix summary_view so shows thumbnails for contents with the image field,
          see http://dev.plone.org/ticket/13010 [kroman0]
        
        - Fix thumbnail_view so it works when Images or News Items are listed,
          see http://dev.plone.org/ticket/13010 [kroman0]
        
        - Avoid site error on summary view if some scale generation have failed.
          [thomasdesvenain, kroman0]
        
        - Remove plone.directives.form dependency.
          [timo]
        
        
        2.0b2 (2012-08-31)
        ------------------
        
        - Item count attribute added to control the number of items in a batch.
          [timo]
        
        - BBB methods added to collection class.
          [timo]
        
        - Remove code to remove the ATContentTypes 'Topic' type since this type is not
          present in Plone 4.2 any longer.
          [timo]
        
        
        2.0b1 (2012-03-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Remove archetypes-based Topic content type on install.
          [timo]
        
        - Do not hide sort_on and sort_reversed on the field level, since this will
          break the JS code for sorting in plone.formwidget.querystring. At some
          point we have to refactor the code to make plone.formwidget.querystring use
          z3c.form only for sorting.
          [timo]
