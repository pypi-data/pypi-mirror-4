Title:  Lamson 1.0pre11 Out, Minor Bug Fixes, One Crash

I just pushed out Lamson 1.0pre11, which has the following changes:


<pre>
=== 2009-12-20 ===
18:12:03 [86905426c5] *CURRENT* Lamson 1.0pre11 release. (user: zedshaw tags:
         trunk, 1.0pre11)
18:05:53 [ea07801db2] Slight tweak to the version number so it matches how
         fossil does it. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
18:03:09 [fa366c52e3] Version bump and fixed the repository revision to use
         fossil's. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
17:40:33 [3429d60e0a] send command shouldn't require username/password
         options. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
16:37:02 [2e4b343250] Fixed up the prototype so that it has a more explicit
         test saying to set the hostname. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
16:30:08 [ccf0879149] These empty log files are annoying, people will just
         have to make the directories. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
16:16:43 [f83c680521] Fix in the prototype to set the undeliverable queue to a
         Queue. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
16:14:29 [6846d43d79] Fixed a stupid bug in the queue receiver's processing
         loop. Now it will never die. (user: zedshaw tags: trunk)
=== 2009-12-13 ===
21:58:20 [0f1044af31] Update prior to release of 1.0pre10. (user: zedshaw
         tags: trunk)
20:59:39 [04be77cc30] Actually *now* the damn __nonzero__ is fixed. (user:
         zedshaw tags: trunk, 1.0pre10)
</pre>

Most of these are fairly minor, but the big one is that there was *still* a 
crash possible if the lamson.queue.Queue class hit an email it couldn't pull
out of the maildir queue it was managing.  Now when it hits a bad email, no
matter what it will put it into the undeliverable queue and then sleep before
processing the rest of the queue.

The down side to this approach is that it still could go down in the except
handler, so I'll be running it for a while and then tweaking the handling 
to be smarter.


Alright, feel free to "get the goods":/releases/ and report back to me
