Version 2.4.0.5
===============

  * Add display_name function field which can be used in both a b2c and b2b
    context to display the name of the current user
  * Add the name of the user who uploaded the attachment to ir.attachment

Version 0.3
===========

 * User model is now nereid.user. Previously user records were stored in 
   party.address. Now it _inherits from party and is stored in a separate
   table

 * All tests must inherit from nereid.testing.TestCase as it implements an
   automatic creation of database and dropping of it after each TestCase is
   executed.
