AWS CloudFormation
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

AWS CloudFormation enables you to create and manage AWS infrastructure
deployments predictably and repeatedly. AWS CloudFormation helps you
leverage AWS products such as Amazon EC2, EBS, Amazon SNS, ELB, and
Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost effective
applications without worrying about creating and configuring the
underlying the AWS infrastructure.

With AWS CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and
dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of
resources as a single unit called a stack. AWS CloudFormation creates
and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all
dependencies between the resources for you.

Product Page .

Amazon CloudFormation makes use of other AWS products. If you need
additional technical information about a specific AWS product, you can
