Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package defines a browser view ``@@poimail`` that reads an email
        from the request and creates an issue for that or adds a response to
        an issue.  It is a bridge between smtp2zope_ and `Products.Poi`_.
        
        .. _smtp2zope: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/smtp2zope
        .. _`Products.Poi`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.Poi
        
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        This has been tested with Plone 3.3.5 and Products.Poi 1.2.11.  Should
        work fine with Plone 4.x and Poi 2.x as well.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        A standard setup would look like this:
        
        - You have a Plone Site at http://example.org/.
        
        - This Plone Site has ``Products.Poi`` and ``poi.receivemail`` in its
          eggs.
        
        - The site has a Poi tracker at http://example.org/tracker.
        
        - You have installed ``smtp2zope`` on the same machine (possibly in
          the same buildout, but a virtualenv is fine too) and its script is
          available at ``/path/to/smtp2zope``.
        
        - You have a mail server on this machine that has an alias like this::
        
            helpdesk@example.org "|/path/to/smtp2zope http://example.org/tracker/@@poimail"
        
          or this::
        
            helpdesk@example.org "|/path/to/smtp2zope http://admin:secret@example.org/tracker/@@poimail 1000000"
        
        - Now when someone sends an email to helpdesk@example.org a new issue
          is created in the tracker.  When the subject of the email matches an
          existing issue, it is added as response to that issue.
        
        - When a user is found in the Plone Site that matches the sender
          address, we pretend to be that user when creating the issue or
          response.  Otherwise, the Creator is anonymous or is the user that
          is identified through basic authentication in the url that is passed
          as argument to ``smtp2zope``.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.11 (2012-10-14)
        -----------------
        
        - Moved to https://github.com/collective/poi.receivemail
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.10 (2011-12-14)
        -----------------
        
        - Fixed wrong match for issue by subject.  While searching for #123 in
          the subject line we would match 123 at the beginning of the line as
          well, which may give wrong matches.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.9 (2011-11-28)
        ----------------
        
        - Use the body charset to decode the body text and then encode it as
          utf-8 before storing it.
          [maurits]
        
        - Avoid a unicode error when there is no body.
          [maurits]
        
        - Optionally add attachments from the e-mail.  We look for binary
          attachments.  These are added as separate responses, as you can only
          add one attachment per issue or response.  In config.py we have
          added a setting ADD_ATTACHMENTS for this (default True) to make it a
          bit easier to switch this off in case of problems or when you do not
          want it.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed handling multipart messages that have parts that themselves
          are multipart.
          [maurits]
        
        - When there is an empty or missing Subject line, use '[no subject]'
          as title.  We do not try to match such a mail to a previous issue
          but always create a new one.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.8 (2011-11-10)
        ----------------
        
        - Set more fields explicitly, as the createObjectByType call only sets
          some of them.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.7 (2011-11-09)
        ----------------
        
        - When a subject (keyword, category) is given, set that explicitly.
          [maurits]
        
        - In ``get_addresses`` allow getting addresses from headers other than
          To and From as well.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.6 (2011-09-06)
        ----------------
        
        - Prevent issues from being automatically renamed after they are
          edited.
          [maurits]
        
        - Prevent some more lower-case email address comparison problems.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.5 (2011-06-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Make e-mail from address lower-case to prevent search problems with ldap
          users. [jladage]
        
        
        1.4 (2011-06-14)
        ----------------
        
        - When searching PAS for a user by email address, strip off any white
          space (like possibly '\r\n' in ldap) from the returned addresses, to
          avoid non-matching for silly reasons.
          [maurits]
        
        - Moved all options to a new config.py file.
          [maurits]
        
        - Add option ADVANCED_SUBJECT_MATCH.  Default is False: we only check
          for '#123' in the Subject line, to avoid matching overly generic
          Subject lines like 'Hi' or 'Problem'.  To get back the previous
          behavior, set this to True (in a patch in your own code, likely).
          [maurits]
        
        - If the subject is empty, do not try to find a matching issue, as all
          issues will match.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.3 (2011-05-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Added FAKE_MANAGER option (default is True) to determine if we
          should fake a Manager role to be sure that a post succeeds.
          [maurits]
        
        - While switching users: if 'email' is not in the properties (say:
          ldap), we can get far too many results; so we do a double check.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.2 (2011-05-09)
        ----------------
        
        - Ignore mails with the email_from_address as From address, as this
          too easily means that a message sent by Poi ends up being added as a
          reply on an issue that we have just created.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.1 (2011-05-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Handle encoded subject lines better.
          [maurits]
        
        
        1.0 (2011-05-05)
        ----------------
