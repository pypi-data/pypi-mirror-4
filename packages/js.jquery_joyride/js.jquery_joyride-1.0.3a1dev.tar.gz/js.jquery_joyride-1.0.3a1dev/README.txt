js.jquery_joyride
*****************

Introduction
============

This library packages `joyride`_ for `fanstatic`_, a library to provide a 
feature tour on a website.

Currently it packages an unreleased version of a fork_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`joyride`: https://github.com/zurb/joyride
.. _`fork`: https://github.com/majido/joyride

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_joyride``) are published to some URL.
