create-snapshot-from-volume-recovery-point
******************************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation initiates a snapshot of a gateway from a volume
recovery point. This operation is supported only for the gateway-
cached volume architecture (see StorageGatewayConcepts ).

A volume recovery point is a point in time at which all data of the
volume is consistent and from which you can create a snapshot. To get
a list of volume recovery point for gateway-cached volumes, use  list-
volume-recovery-points .

In the "create-snapshot-from-volume-recovery-point" request, you
identify the volume by providing its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You
must also provide a description for the snapshot. When AWS Storage
Gateway takes a snapshot of the specified volume, the snapshot and its
description appear in the AWS Storage Gateway console. In response,
AWS Storage Gateway returns you a snapshot ID. You can use this
snapshot ID to check the snapshot progress or later use it when you
want to create a volume from a snapshot.

Note: To list or delete a snapshot, you must use the Amazon EC2 API. For
  more information, go to DeleteSnapshot and DescribeSnapshots in
  *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference* .
