enable-availability-zones-for-load-balancer
*******************************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Adds one or more EC2 Availability Zones to the LoadBalancer.

The LoadBalancer evenly distributes requests across all its registered
Availability Zones that contain instances. As a result, the client
must ensure that its LoadBalancer is appropriately scaled for each
registered Availability Zone.

Note: The new EC2 Availability Zones to be added must be in the same EC2
  Region as the Availability Zones for which the LoadBalancer was
  created.
