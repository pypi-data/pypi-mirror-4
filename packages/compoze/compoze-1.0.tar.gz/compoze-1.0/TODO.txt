compoze TOODs
=============

- [X] Break monolithic command (version 0.1) into subcommands, and make
      them pluggable via entry points.

- [X] Fix the ``compoze show`` command to get real values from PyPI.

      * Unit tests mock it away too well.

- [X] Allow use of a a config file for setting defaults:
 
      * ``verbose``

      * ``index-url``

      * ``find-links``

      * ``fetch-site-packages``

      * ``include-binary-eggs``

      * ``keep-tempdir``

- [X] Add options to the ``compoze show`` and ``compoze fetch`` commands
      to allow specifying an INI file and section containing project
      requirements, using the format used by ``zc.buildout``.

      This should allow us to manage muliple overlapping indexes, each
      with a separate list of "known good" sets, but sharing a pool of
      distributions.

- [_] Make ``compoze show`` understand the new PEP345 fields.

      o Use the updated release of ``pkginfo``, which parses them by default.

- [_] Make ``compoze show`` handle the ``--find-links`` argument (currently
      accepted but has no effect).

      o Consolidate shared logic w/ ``compoze fetch``?

- [_] Add an 'install' command, which emulateds 'easy_install' but
      with the following differences:

      o it is willing to check multiple indexes

      o it records the index from which each package was downloaded
        somewhere (do we care?)

      o it saves the source distribution by default.

- [_] Add an 'upgrade' command, which checks all installed packages
      in the working set against the specified (or configured) indexes.
