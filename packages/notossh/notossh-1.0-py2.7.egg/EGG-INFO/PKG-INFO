        WHATEVER
        ========
        
        that code is a quick and dirty hack to get notifications over ssh from my server
        running irssi to my workstation. Aimed to be extended with other notification
        systems.

        for original notify.pl code :
        
         * http://lewk.org/log/code/irssi-notify
        
        INSTALL
        =======
        
         * REMOTE SHELL running ERC
        
        TODO by someone who uses ERC!
        
         * REMOTE SHELL running IRSSI
        
        1/  copy 'notify.pl' to your ~/.irssi/scripts folder
            i.e. scp notify.pl REMOTE:.irssi/scripts
        2/  do '/load perl' and '/script load notify.pl' in irssi
            - TIP: Add it to your irssi conf to auto load
        3/  Ensure SSH allows remote tunnels - i.e. GatewayPorts yes
        4/  configure the 'highlights' in your client. (if you don't know how RTFM !)
            - /hilight -regex bla|bla
        
         * Local SSH Client
        
        1/  install the local service either by doing: 
            1.1/ pip install notossh
            1.2/ python setup.py install
        4/  configure how you want to instance it
            4.1/ configure your ssh client to run it (see below)
            4.2/ make your own script (or launch it manually) : `notossh start`
            4.3/ to end the service run : `notossh stop`
        6/  if you don't like it as is... HACK IT !
        
        OPTIONS
        =======
        
            usage: irssi-notify-listener.py [-h] [-f] [-S] [-V] [-H HOST] [-P PORT]
                                            [-G GROWL] [-N NOTIFY]
                                            {start,stop} ...
        
            IRSSI Notify Listener
        
            positional arguments:
            {start,stop}
                start               Starts the service
                stop                Stops the service
        
            optional arguments:
            -h, --help            show this help message and exit
            -f, --foreground      Make the notifications stick
            -S, --sticky          Make the notifications stick
            -V, --verbose         Make the listener verbose
            -H HOST, --host HOST  Host to listen on
            -P PORT, --port PORT  Port to listen on
            -G GROWL, --with-growl GROWL
                                    Path to growl executable
            -N NOTIFY, --with-notify NOTIFY
                                    Path to notify executable
        
        CONFIGURATION
        =============
        
        add to your .ssh/config those lines, where HOST is the host and port the PORT you want
        to connect to :
        
            Host HOST
            PermitLocalCommand yes
            LocalCommand "/path/to/bin/notossh start"
            RemoteForward PORT localhost:PORT
        
        NOTIFICATIONS
        =============
        
        to change the way notifications behaves, like on Fedora systems, you can change the notification
        line to the following, making it transient :
        
            return [args.notify, '--hint', 'int:transient:1', '-i', 'dialog-information', '-t', '5000', ':'.join(args[1:]), args[0]]
        
        TODO
        ====
        
         * enable passing through the arguments after -- to the notification service
        
        LICENCES
        ========
        
        Since 2010, that code is aimed to be hacked.
        Thanks to Charles `doublerebel` Philips, Rui Abreu Ferreira and Cooper Ry Lees for their hacks!
        
        notify.pl is under GPL (because I copy/pasted it from Luke Macken and Paul W. Frields)
        
        everything else is WTFPL (because I don't care what you do with it, but if you don't 
        tell me you've improved it it, you're just a moron)
        
        And if you like it, buy me a beer !
