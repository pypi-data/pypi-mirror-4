Description: boolparser
        ==========================
        
        This package defines a simple boolean parser using PyParsing that allows user defined variables and floating point numbers to be used in a nested boolean comparison. For example, if the variables *a*,*b*, and *c* are defined then the following string can be parsed
        
            (a==1 & b<2) | c>4
        
        The resolution of *a*, *b*, and *c* is left up to the user by inheriting from the class `EvaluateVariable` class and overriding the `eval` function. This allows the variables to be references to (say) data stored in a file.
