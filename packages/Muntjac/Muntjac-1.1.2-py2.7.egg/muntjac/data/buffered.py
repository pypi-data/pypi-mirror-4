    I{Read-through mode} means that the value read from the buffered object
    is constantly up to date with the data source. I{Write-through} mode
    means that all changes to the object are immediately updated to the data
    source.

    Since these modes are independent, their combinations may result in some
    behaviour that may sound surprising.

    For example, if a C{IBuffered} object is in read-through mode but
    not in write-through mode, the result is an object whose value is updated
    directly from the data source only if it's not locally modified. If the
    value is locally modified, retrieving the value from the object would
    result in a value that is different than the one stored in the data source,
    even though the object is in read-through mode.
