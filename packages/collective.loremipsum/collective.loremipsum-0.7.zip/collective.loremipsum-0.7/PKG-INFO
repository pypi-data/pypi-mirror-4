Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.loremipsum is a developer tool to create dummy content and
        dummy members inside your Plone site. 
        
        Plain text fields are populated with text from the `loremipsum`_ Python
        library, while rich text is retrieved from `loripsum.net`_.
        
        The user data for the dummy members were downloaded from
        `fakenamegenerator.com`_.
        
        * After it's installed (via the Plone control panel or the portal_quickinstaller tool), you'll see a new editbar tab labeled "Populate" on all folderish content types. Clicking this tab brings up a form with parameters for specifying the kinds of objects to create, how many and the lorem ipsum rich text formatting. Objects can also be created recursively.
        
        * You can also register 500 dummy users, but for the moment only by calling the browserview: **@@create-dummy-users**
