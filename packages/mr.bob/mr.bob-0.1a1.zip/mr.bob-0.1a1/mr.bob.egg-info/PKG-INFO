        TODO
        ====
        
        - [high] Questions have random order at the moment
        - [medium] Check how one would implement multi-namespace python package with current mr.bob api
        - [medium] Consider http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/code/treedict/overview.html#overview for variables storage
        - [medium] Ability to configure what to ignore when copying templates in bobconfig
        - [medium] validate questions being answered through config files
        - [medium] better format print questions output
        - [medium] non-interactive support (disable last phase of configuration)
        - [medium] figure out how templates can depend on each other (bobconfig setting with a list of template names?)
        - [medium] ability to use multiple templates at the same time and depend on them (similar templer structures, but doesnt separate structures and templates)
        - [low] implement post_run_msg
        - [low] ability to have localcommands (maybe we dont need that because of multiple templates?)
        - [low] ability to specify pre/post functions when rendering templates
        - [low] ability to specify actions to answers, for example if one question was answered, another template may be triggered
        - [low] ability to specify answers to questions from cli
        - [low] ability to simulate rendering (dry-run)
        - [low] ability to rewrite templates
        - [low] ability to remember answers for the rendered template (goes together with updating/overriding templates)
