Running the tests
=================

The tests suite requires nose_ and is compatible with both Python 2 and
Python 3.  To run the full test suite::

    $ python setup.py nosetests

Where ``python`` is the Python executable to use for the tests.  E.g. this
might be ``python3`` for Python 3, or the Python executable from a
virtualenv_.
