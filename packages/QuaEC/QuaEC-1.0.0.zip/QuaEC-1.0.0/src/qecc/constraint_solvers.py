    Given commutation constraints on a Pauli operator, yields an iterator onto
    all solutions of those constraints.
    
    :param commutation_constraints: A list of operators :math:`\{A_i\}` such
        that each solution :math:`P` yielded by this function must satisfy
        :math:`[A_i, P] = 0` for all :math:`i`.
    :param commutation_constraints: A list of operators :math:`\{B_i\}` such
        that each solution :math:`P` yielded by this function must satisfy
        :math:`\{B_i, P\} = 0` for all :math:`i`.
    :param search_in_gens: A list of operators :math:`\{N_i\}` that generate
        the group in which to search for solutions. If ``None``, defaults to
        the elementary generators of the pc.Pauli group on :math:`n` qubits, where
        :math:`n` is given by the length of the commutation and anticommutation
        constraints.
    :param search_in_set: An iterable of operators to which the search for 
        satisfying assignments is restricted. This differs from ``search_in_gens``
        in that it specifies the entire set, not a generating set. When this
        parameter is specified, a brute-force search is executed. Use only
        when the search set is small, and cannot be expressed using its generating
        set. 
    :returns: An iterator ``it`` such that ``list(it)`` contains all operators
        within the group :math:`G = \langle N_1, \dots, N_k \rangle\rangle`
        given by ``search_in_gens``, consistent with the commutation and
        anticommutation constraints.
        
    This function is based on finding the generators of the centralizer groups 
    of each commutation constraint, and is thus faster than a predicate-based
    search over the entire group of interest. The resulting iterator can be
    used in conjunction with other filters, however.
