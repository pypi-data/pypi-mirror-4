Description: PyCNV
        ==========================
        
        This is a parser for Sea Bird CTD output files.
        
        The `Sea Bird CTD`_ post processed data usually uses the .cnv extention. The
        purpose of the PyCNV is to parse this type of files, considering the different
        versions along the time, as well as different setups.
        
        At this point my goal is to have an object with the attributes parsed from the
        header, and the data as Masked Arrays, so that the user don't need to loose
        time evaluating the version and details of that cnv, but have it in a
        standard pattern, ready to use.

        Support and Documentation
        -------------------------
        
        See the `PyCNV Wiki`_ to view documentation, report bugs, and obtain support.
        
        The `Seasoft`_ manual might be the best reference for the format used.
        
        The variables names were based on the `pcmdi standard name table`

        0.2
        ---

        0.1.8
        -----
        
        * Refactoring. Parsed text is saved in self.parsed, preparing to output
            everything that wasn't specifically parsed.
        * XML is extracted into self.attributes['awkward_xml']
        
        0.1.7
        -----
        
        * Now it calculate and include the hex md5sum.
        * Bugfix, now handle well when timeJ has masked values.
        * Bugfix converting timeJ, it was one day longer.
        * I'll run on the whole PIRATA dataset to check against different formats
            and after that it will be ready for 0.2 as Beta version
        
        0.1.6
        -----
        
        * When position available in the header.intro as NMEA, load this instead of
            try to parse from the header.notes.
        * Load default values from a yaml file, like attributes{cruise, project, 
            shipname ...}
        * Using a recommended variable names list
        
        0.1.5

        * Initial prototype of the cnvdump

        * It's able to load the variables into Masked Array, but it's not the best way to do it.
