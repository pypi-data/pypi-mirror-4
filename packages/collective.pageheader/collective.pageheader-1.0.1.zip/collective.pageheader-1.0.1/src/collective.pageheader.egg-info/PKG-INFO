        Introduction
        ============
        
        A Plone package for adding an image header to your contents.
        
        It adds a new image field called 'Page header' to all your content types.
        
        If an header is found on the context this will be used as header image, otherwise the machinery will look up into parents to find one. 
        
        In this way we can have a section header and override it per-content.
        
        The image field is injected using archetypes.schemaextender, of course.
        
        The image is showed within the viewlet `pageheader` that by default is assigned to the manager `belowcontenttitle`.
        
        There's no custom CSS so at first it appears a bit 'raw'. It's upon you to provide the better style for your header ;).
