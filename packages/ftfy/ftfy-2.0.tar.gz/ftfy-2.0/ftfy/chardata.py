#
#   0 = not weird at all
#   1 = rare punctuation or rare letter that someone could certainly
#       have a good reason to use. All Windows-1252 gremlins are at least
#       weirdness 1.
#   2 = things that probably don't appear next to letters or other
#       symbols, such as math or currency symbols
#   3 = obscure symbols that nobody would go out of their way to use
#       (includes symbols that were replaced in ISO-8859-15)
#   4 = why would you use this?
#   5 = unprintable control character
#
# The Portuguese letter Ãƒ (0xc3) is marked as weird because it would usually
# appear in the middle of a word in actual Portuguese, and meanwhile it
# appears in the mis-encodings of many common characters.
