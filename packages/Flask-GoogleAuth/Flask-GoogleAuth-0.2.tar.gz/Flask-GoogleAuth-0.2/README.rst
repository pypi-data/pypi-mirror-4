Flask-GoogleAuth
================
This is a partial port of torando.auth to be used with Flask.

Inspired by Kenneth Reitz.


Usage
-----
Example usage for Google Federated Login. Greate for internal apps.

Require an account from a given Google Apps domain for your Flask apps::

    from flask import Flask
    from flask.ext.googleauth import GoogleFederated

    # Setup Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.secret_key = "random secret key"

    # Setup Google Federated Auth
    auth = GoogleFederated(app, "heroku.com")

    @app.route("/")
    @auth.required
    def secret():
        # Once user is authenticated, his name and email are accessible as
        # g.user.name and g.user.email.
        return "ssssshhhhh (c) kennethreitz"

If you want to authenticate your users with general Google OpenID you should import and use ``GoogleAuth`` instead of ``GoogleFederated``::

    auth = GoogleAuth(app)

    @app.route("/")
    @auth.required
    def secret():
        return "You have rights to be here, %s" % g.user.name


Install
-------
To install Flask-GoogleAuth::

    pip install flask-googleauth


Prerequisites
-------------
Be sure that your Google Apps domain is enabled to be an OpenID provider under "Advanced tools" â†’ "Federated Login using OpenID".
