Execute a standalone Python script after having set up the Django 
environment. Also modify `sys.args` and `__name__` so that 
the invoked script sees them as if it had been called directly.

This is yet another answer to the frequently asked Django question
about how to run standalone Django scripts
(`[1] <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4847469/use-django-from-python-manage-py-shell-to-python-script>`__,
`[2] <http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/sep/22/standalone-django-scripts/>`__).
It is almost the same as redirecting stdin of Django's ``shell`` command 
(i.e. doing ``python manage.py shell < myscript.py``), but without the disturbing 
messages from the interactive console.

For example if you have a file `myscript.py` with the following content...

::

  from lino.modlib.contacts.models import Partner
  print Partner.objects.all()

... then you can run this script using::

  $ python manage.py run myscript.py
  [<Partner: Rumma & Ko OÃœ>, ...  <Partner: Charlier Ulrike>, 
  '...(remaining elements truncated)...']
