        Introduction
        ============
        
        Logtail allows you to view logfiles for your django project via your django
        admin, and will also provide you with a live tail of the logfiles using ajax
        polling - and therefore without the need for a long-running django process.
        
        Django 1.3+ compatible.
        
        See Also: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django_logtail
        
        Installation and Use
        ====================
        
        Django logtail takes a dictionary from your settings.py as follows::
        
            LOGTAIL_FILES = {
                'apache': '/var/www/www.foo.com.log',
                'django', '/var/log/www.foo.com/project.log',
            }
        
        Add it via your installed apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'django_logtail',
            )
        
        If any of your django admin plugin apps already add a jquery header::
        
            LOGTAIL_INCLUDE_JQUERY = False # Default is True
        
        Next hook it into your root_urlconf, above the bog-standard admin urls::
        
            from django_logtail import urls as logtail_urls
        
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
                # First this
                url(r'^admin/django_logtail/', include(logtail_urls)),
        
                # Then this
                url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
                ...
            )
        
        Then absolutely ensure that the user that your django process runs as (whether
        it's via wsgi, fastcgi, django runserver for debugging, or something else) has
        permission to read all of the files in your LOGTAIL_FILES list.
        
        logtail should then appear in your admin, and provide access to these files -
        including a live tail of the file.
        
        Simples.
        
        Other Settings
        ==============
        
        You can set the default update interval for the log tailing::
        
            LOGTAIL_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 50000 # Default is 3000 (three second)
