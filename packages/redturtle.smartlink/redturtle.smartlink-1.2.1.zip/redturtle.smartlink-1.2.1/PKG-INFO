        Introduction
        ============
        
        An enhanced version of the base Plone link content type.
        
        After installing this you'll see that the Plone link will have a new *image* and *caption* fields
        like the News Item content type.
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/redturtle.smartlink-1.0.0rc2-1.png
           :alt: Advanced fields tab
        
        Also the new Link type can handle internal (to Plone contents) and external links. You can use the
        internal link field to automatically attach the link value to an internal content of the portal
        (in a similar way used for related contents).
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/redturtle.smartlink-1.0.0rc2-2.png
           :alt: The Smart Link edit form
        
        An event-based system will also keep URLs updated even when you move/rename target document.
        
        You can also customize the link icon for being able to use a different icon from the default Plone ones.
        Due to changes between Plone 3 and Plone 4 themes, we need to keep the Plone 3 approach for displaying icons
        (not using CSS sprite. To restore the Plone 4 default way, disable the ``smart_link.css`` resource
        and remove the "*Icon (Expression)*" value from ``portal_types`` tool).
        
        Handle back-end/front-end URLs
        ------------------------------
        
        The Smart Link structure is nothing more that a ATLink content, so the way used to store URL
        in the object or in the site's catalog is the same as Plone. There is no magic behind.
        
        For this reason, when you are using Smart Link for internal references, the *static* URL is
        stored and used.
        
        This will lead to problems when you are using this product for site where you have different
        back-end/front-end URLs; those problems are the same you have when you don't use this product!
        
        For this reason you must use the "*Configure Smart Link*" control panel to handle URL transformation.
        
        .. image:: http://keul.it/images/plone/redturtle.smartlink-1.0.0rc2-3.png
           :alt: The 'Configure Smart Link' panel
        
        You can also use an option that says to Smart Link to store relative URLs, but this will also
        include the Plone site id in every link (and you must rewrite this from Apache if you don't
        like this). 
        
        Blob and Blob migration tool
        ----------------------------
        
        SmartLink supports (starting from 1.0.0 revision) the use of blob for the image field.
        In this way we doesn't increases the size of Data.fs .
        
        The Blob support for SmartLink is activated only if `plone.app.blob`__ is installed.
        Plone 4 has Blob as storage default for the images and the files.
        On Plone 3.x you have to install it by yourself.
        
        __ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.blob
        
        If you have already created Smark Link contents with an old version that doesn't support Blobs
        you have to launch a migration utility from the Smart Link control panel. 
        
        E.g.: http://myhost/@@blob-smartlink-migration
        
        Migrate ATLink to Smart Link (and back)
        ---------------------------------------
        
        Smart Link contains two Generic Setup import steps that can help you to transform all you ATLink
        to Smart Link, or to go back to ATLink if you don't like Smart Link anymore (automatically done
        when you uninstall the product).
        
        Warning 1
        ---------
        
        Smart Link shape-change itself to be the Link content type, and hide the basic Plone Link type. Old ATLink
        already created will continue working normally, but only new created link will behave the Smart Link
        features.
        
        Warning 2
        ---------
        
        **Pay attention** when you update the whole portal_catalog using ZMI from URLs different from
        back-end or front-end ones (for example: using a SSH tunnel).
        
        If you run the update from (for example) "localhost:8090/site" and this URL is not the public
        or one of the back-end URLs, all your internal links will be changed to this hostname!
        Another catalog update (from the right URL) will fix this.
        
        Safe re-install, clean uninstall
        --------------------------------
        
        You can *re-install* Smart Link safely for upgrade task or for restore changes, without any problem.
        
        If you *uninstall* it, all data from Smart Link will be removed. This means that if you re-install
        it after all your internal links will not be linked to target contents.
        
        Requirements

        Plone 3 notes

        There's some kwno issues for this product on Plone 3.3:
        
        * uninstall will probably not work (you can try to add to your buildout `experimental.backportGS`__)
        * uninstall will restore the Plone 4 style Link
        * you must manually activate `plone.app.imaging`__ in your Plone site

        Before this: ComboLink
        ----------------------
        
        Part of the code of Smart Link was taken from the `ComboLink`__ Plone (and Plonegov) product.
        This project was giving the same internal link feature in old 2.1/2.5 Plone releases.

        ---------------------
        
        * Plone 4 compatibility [keul]
        * The explicit use of *iw.fss* has been removed. The *fss.zcml* is still there and you can still include

        * Aligned the *smartlink_view* with the latest Plone *link_view*, so now will also display the message

        * Added tests [keul]
        * Updated and fixed labels and texts all around and i18n translation too [keul]
        * Splitted UI error warn when you don't provide neither internal and external link, from the fact that you
          provide both of them [keul]
        * When unlinking an internal content, it's cleaned from marker interface [keul]
        * Switched front-end and back-end order in the config panel [keul]
        * Fixed a bug that force the front-end URLs in config panel to be unique [keul]

        0.7.2 (2010-04-06)
        ------------------
        
        * The "*smartLink*" event was using *directlyProvides* instead of *alsoProvides*... this was
          corrupting some target objects (like: it was impossible to internally link a file that
          use blobs) [keul]
        * Removed the Plone 3.3+ dependency because Smart Link is providing the same feature
          given by Plone 3.3 also on older Plone versions [keul]
        
        0.7.1 (2010-03-26)

        * Aligned with changes done to ATLink from Plone 3.3 [keul]
        * Added a fake *link_redirect_view* [keul]
        
        0.6.1 (2010-03-10)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed egg format [keul]
        * README updated [keul]

        ------------------
        
        * Changed name of tool [fdelia]
        * Added icon for tool [fdelia]
        
        0.5.1 (2010-02-02)

        * Fix for the corrupted version 0.5.0 [fdelia]
        
        0.5.0 (2010-01-25)
        ------------------

        0.4.0 (2009-09-12)
        ------------------
        
        * Keep relations of internal link even if the target content is renamed/moved [keul]
        * Added a marker interface for internally linked contents [keul]
        * When target object is deleted, the internal relation became a normal absolute URL info [keul]
        
        0.3.1 (2009-08-30)
        ------------------
        
        * Restored the original *remoteUrl* StringField , due to continuous bad integration with 3rd party
          products (like p4a and collective.flowplayer) [keul]
        
        0.3.0 (2009-08-02)
        ------------------

          After migrating to this version from the 0.1.0 you can also launch the **fix_meta_data** external method
          or your folder will remains broken.
