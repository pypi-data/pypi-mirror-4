        Features
        --------
        Cerberus provides type checking and other base functionality out of the box and
        is designed to be non-blocking and easily extensible, allowing for custom
        validation. It has no dependancies and is thoroughly tested under Python 2.6
        and 2.7. Support for Python 3.x is planned as well.
