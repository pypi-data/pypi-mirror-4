Introduction
===============

Sevabot webhooks is a way to send Skype messages
from external services using HTTP GET and POST requests.

Because there is no "webhook" standard Sevabot supports different
ways to parse HTTP message payloads

* Signed and unsigned messages: shared secret MD5 signature prevents sending
  messages from hostile services

* HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests

* Service specific JSON payloads

To send a message to a chat you must first know to to the
id of a group chat. Sevabot server HTTP interface has a page
to show this list (see below).

Supported services and examples
============================================

Here are some services and examples how to integrate Sevabot

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   bash
   python
   zapier
   github
   subversion
   jenkins
   zabbix


Getting chat list
=======================

To send messages throught the bot you need to know

* Skype chat id - we use MD5 encoded ids to conveniently pass them in URLs.

* Sevabot shared secret in ``settings.py`` (only if your service supports MD5 signing, like your own custom shell script)

To get list of the chat ids visit in the Sevabot server hosted address::

    http://localhost:5000/

It will return a HTTP page containing a list of Sevabot internal chat ids.

Sending a message over HTTP interface
==============================================

One can send MD5 signed (safer) or unsigned messages (optional due to constrains in external services)

We provide

* signed endpoint http://localhost:5000/msg/YOURCHATIT/ - see Bash example for more info

* unsigned endpoint http://localhost:5000/zapier/YOURCHATIT/YOURSHAREDSECRET/ - takes in HTTP POST data parameter

Timed messages
=================

Use external clocking service like `UNIX cron <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto>`_ to send regular or timed messages to Sevabot Skype chat over HTTP webhooks interface.
