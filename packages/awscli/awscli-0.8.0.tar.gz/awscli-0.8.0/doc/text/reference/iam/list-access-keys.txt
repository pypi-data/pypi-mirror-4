list-access-keys
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns information about the Access Key IDs associated with the
specified user. If there are none, the action returns an empty list.

Although each user is limited to a small number of keys, you can still
paginate the results using the "--max-items" and "--marker"
parameters.

If the "--user-name" field is not specified, the --user-name is
determined implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID used to sign the
request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, this API can be used to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.

Note: To ensure the security of your AWS account, the secret access key is
  accessible only during key and user creation.


SYNOPSIS

REQUIRED PARAMETERS

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--user-name"  (string)
   Name of the user.

"--marker"  (string)
   Use this parameter only when paginating results, and only in a
   subsequent request after you've received a response where the
   results are truncated. Set it to the value of the "--marker"
   element in the response you just received.

"--max-items"  (integer)
   Use this parameter only when paginating results to indicate the
   maximum number of keys you want in the response. If there are
   additional keys beyond the maximum you specify, the "IsTruncated"
   response element is "true" .
