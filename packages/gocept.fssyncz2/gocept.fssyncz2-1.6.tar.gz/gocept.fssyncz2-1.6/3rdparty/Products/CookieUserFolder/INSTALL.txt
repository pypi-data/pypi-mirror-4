Installing the CookieUserFolder Product

    You will need Zope version 2.3.0 or higher!

    This product does not require any special handling after unzipping
    and untarring it in the Zope Products directory. You should do 
    something like::

        $ cp CookieUserFolder-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ tar zxvf CookieUserFolder-xyz.tgz
        <watch files being decompressed>

    That's all. Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards.

    To help those who want to replace an existing standard Zope user 
    folder this package now includes a script that can be run as an
    external method from within Zope to migrate user accounts from the
    old user folder into the Cookie User Folder. See README.txt for 
    instructions. This migration script will only work for standard 
    Zope user folders.

    See README.txt for any other dependencies and requirements.
