  instance act similar then the original pymongo Connection class __init__
  method.

0.6.0 (2012-01-17)
------------------

- bugfix: During a query, if a spec key is missing from the doc, the doc is
  always ignored.

- bugfix: correctly generate an object id in UTC. It was relying on GMT+1
  (i.e. Roger's timezone).

- bugfix: allow to use None as MongoDateProperty value

- bugfix: set __parent__ in MongoSubItem __init__ method if given

- implemented _m_initialized as a marker for find out when we need to trace
  changed attributes

- implemented clear method in MongoListData and MongoItemsData which allows to
  remove sequence items at once wihout to pop each item from the sequence

- improve MongoObject implementation, implemented _field which stores the
  parent field name which the MongoObject is stored at. Also adjsut the
  MongoObjectProperty and support backward compatibility by apply the previous
  stored __name__ as _field if not given. This new _field and __name__
  separation allos us to use explicit names e.g. the _id or custom names which
  we can use for traversing to a MongoObject via traverser or other container
  like implementations.

- Implemented __getattr__ in FakeCollection. This allows to get a sub
  collection like in pymongo which is a part of the gridfs concept.
