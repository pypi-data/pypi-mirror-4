Development
===========

.. highlight:: bash

This package is developed using continuous integration which can be
found here:

http://jenkins.simplistix.co.uk/view/checker/

The latest development version of the documentation can be found here:

http://jenkins.simplistix.co.uk/job/checker-docs/Documentation/

If you wish to contribute to this project, then you should fork the
repository found here:

https://github.com/Simplistix/checker/

Once that has been done, you can follow these
instructions to perform various development tasks:

Setting up the buildout
-----------------------

All development requires that you run the buildout::

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ bin/buildout

Running the tests
-----------------

Once you have a buildout, the tests can be run as follows::

  $ bin/nosetests

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The Sphinx documentation is built by doing the following from the
directory containg setup.py::

  $ cd docs
  $ make html

Making a release
----------------

The first thing to do when making a release is to check that the ReST
to be uploaded to PyPI is valid::

  $ bin/docpy setup.py --long-description | bin/rst2 html \
    --link-stylesheet \
    --stylesheet=http://www.python.org/styles/styles.css > build/desc.html

Once you're certain everything is as it should be, the following will
build the distribution, upload it to PyPI, register the metadata with
PyPI and upload the Sphinx documentation to PyPI::

  $ bin/buildout -o
  $ cd docs
  $ make clean
  $ make html
  $ cd ..
  $ bin/docpy setup.py sdist upload register upload_sphinx --upload-dir=docs/_build/html

The ``bin/buildout`` will make sure the correct package information is
used.

This should all be done on a unix box so that a `.tgz` source
distribution is produced.
