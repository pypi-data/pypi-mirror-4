Continuous testing helper, adapted from [1], but which makes no
assumption about what tests you might want to run continuously while
developing.  See also [2].

Any command supplied to the script will be run once and
then repeated any time the code in the current working directory
changes.  You may wish to edit the IGNORE_* tuples to suit your
particular setup.

Note that ANY command you supply the script will be run, so be
careful.  You have been warned!

Installation:
  ./setup.py install  # from source
or
  easy_install conttest  # or use pip instead of easy_install

Usage examples:
  conttest nosetests
  conttest 'nosetests -q && pep8 -r .'

Placing a file .conttest-excludes in the current working directory
will exclude subdirectories, e.g.:

  .svn
  .git
  build
  install

will skip checking for changes in those directories.  This can save
quite a bit of time and CPU during normal operation.  Currently this
works for top-level directories only!
