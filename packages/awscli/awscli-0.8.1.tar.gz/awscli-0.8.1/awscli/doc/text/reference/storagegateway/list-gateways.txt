list-gateways
*************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation lists gateways owned by an AWS account in a region
specified in the request. The returned list is ordered by gateway
Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

By default, the operation returns a maximum of 100 gateways. This
operation supports pagination that allows you to optionally reduce the
number of gateways returned in a response.

If you have more gateways than are returned in a response-that is, the
response returns only a truncated list of your gateways-the response
contains a marker that you can specify in your next request to fetch
the next page of gateways.
