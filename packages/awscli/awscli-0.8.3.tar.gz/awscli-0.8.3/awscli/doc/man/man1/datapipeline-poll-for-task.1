.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Task runners call this action to receive a task to perform from AWS Data
Pipeline. The task runner specifies which tasks it can perform by setting a
value for the \-\-worker\-group parameter of the poll\-for\-task call. The task
returned by poll\-for\-task may come from any of the pipelines that match the
\-\-worker\-group value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using
the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.
.sp
If tasks are ready in the work queue, poll\-for\-task returns a response
immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, poll\-for\-task uses
long\-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds during
which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner. To
accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The
task runner should not call poll\-for\-task again on the same \-\-worker\-group until
it receives a response, and this may take up to 90 seconds.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-worker\-group\fP  (string)
Indicates the type of task the task runner is configured to accept and
process. The worker group is set as a field on objects in the pipeline when
they are created. You can only specify a single value for \-\-worker\-group in
the call to PollForTask. There are no wildcard values permitted in
workerGroup, the string must be an exact, case\-sensitive, match.

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-hostname\fP  (string)
The public DNS name of the calling task runner.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-instance\-identity\fP  (structure)
Identity information for the Amazon EC2 instance that is hosting the task
runner. You can get this value by calling the URI,
\fBhttp://169.254.169.254/latest/meta\-data/instance\-id\fP , from the EC2
instance. For more information, go to \fI\%Instance Metadata\fP in
the \fIAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.\fP Passing in this value proves
that your task runner is running on an EC2 instance, and ensures the proper
AWS Data Pipeline service charges are applied to your pipeline.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBdocument\fP  (string)
A description of an Amazon EC2 instance that is generated when the instance
is launched and exposed to the instance via the instance meta\-data service
in the form of a JSON representation of an object.
.TP
.B \fBsignature\fP  (string)
A signature which can be used to verify the accuracy and authenticity of the
information provided in the instance identity document.
