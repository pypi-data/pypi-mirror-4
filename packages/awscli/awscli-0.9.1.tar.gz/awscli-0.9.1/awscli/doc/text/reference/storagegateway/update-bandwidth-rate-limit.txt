update-bandwidth-rate-limit
***************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation updates the bandwidth rate limits of a gateway. You can
update both the upload and download bandwidth rate limit or specify
only one of the two. If you don't set a bandwidth rate limit, the
existing rate limit remains.

By default, a gateway's bandwidth rate limits are not set. If you
don't set any limit, the gateway does not have any limitations on its
bandwidth usage and could potentially use the maximum available
bandwidth.

To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of the gateway in your request.
