DESCRIPTION
===========

**Overview** This is the Amazon Redshift API Reference. This guide
provides descriptions and samples of the Amazon Redshift API.

Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and
scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and
backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the
Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire
new insights for your business and customers. **Are You a First-Time
Amazon Redshift User?** If you are a first-time user of , we recommend
that you begin by reading the following sections:

* *Service Highlights and Pricing* - The product detail page provides
  the value proposition, service highlights and pricing.

* *Getting Started* - The Getting Started Guide includes an example
  that walks you through the process of creating a cluster, creating
  database tables, uploading data, and testing queries.

After you complete the Getting Started Guide, we recommend that you
explore one of the following guides:

* *Cluster Management* - If you are responsible for managing Amazon
  Redshift clusters, the Cluster Management Guide shows you how to
  create and manage Amazon Redshift clusters. If you are an
  application developer, you can use the Amazon Redshift Query API to
  manage clusters programmatically. Additionally, the AWS SDK
  libraries that wrap the underlying Amazon Redshift API simplify your
  programming tasks. If you prefer a more interactive way of managing
  clusters, you can use the Amazon Redshift console and the AWS
  command line interface (AWS CLI). For information about the API and
  CLI, go to the following manuals :

* API Reference (*this document* )

* CLI Reference

* *Amazon Redshift Database Database Developer* - If you are a
  database developer, the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide
  explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases
  that make up your data warehouse.

go to the Regions and Endpoints section in the *Amazon Web Services
Glossary* .
