Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This products provides a simple way to manage the search page based on
        portlets.
        
        For simplicity reasons and to avoid conflicts with existing themes, it
        does not override the default search page, but adds a new
        '@@multisearch' page.
        
        A link on this page allows to manage portlets displayed inside the page.
