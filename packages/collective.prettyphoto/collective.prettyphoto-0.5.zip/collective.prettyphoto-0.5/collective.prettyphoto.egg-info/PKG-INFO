        Introduction
        ============
        
        prettyPhoto_ is a jQuery based lightbox clone. It supports images,
        it also add support for videos, flash, YouTube, iFrames and ajax.
        
        It's a full blown media lightbox. The setup is easy and quick, plus the
        script is compatible in every major browser.
        
        This plugin has been tested and is known to work in the following
        browsers:
        
        * Firefox 3.0+
        * Google Chrome 10.0+
        * Internet Explorer 6.0+
        * Safari 3.1.1+
        * Opera 9+
        
        
        `collective.prettyphoto` integrates prettyPhoto 3.1.5 into Plone.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Development focus is now set to Plone 4.x. Currently all 4.x versions
        are tested on `Travis CI`_. Plone 3.x is no longer officially supported.
        
        
        Installing without buildout
        ---------------------------
        
        Install this package in either your system path packages or in the
        ``lib/python`` directory of your Zope instance. You can do this using
        either easy_install or via the ``setup.py`` script.
        
        Installing with buildout
        ------------------------
        
        If you are using buildout_ to manage your instance installing
        collective.prettyphoto is even simpler. You can install
        collective.prettyphoto by adding it to the eggs line for your instance::
        
            [instance]
            eggs = collective.prettyphoto
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ``bin/buildout``,
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        collective.prettyphoto adds a new view for Collections and Folders:
        Thumbnail view (prettyPhoto).
        
        To use prettyPhoto for inline elements just add ``prettyPhoto`` from the
        styles menu in TinyMCE to the link.
        
        
        Configuration

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.5 (2013-04-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Documentation updates
          [saily]
        
        - Upgrade to prettyPhoto 3.1.5
          [saily]
        
        - Add ui-tests using robotframework to validate views.
          [saily]
        
        - Add travis integration for Plone 4.3.x, Plone 4.2.x, Plone 4.1.x and
          Plone 4.0.x. Plone 3.3.x cannot be tested with new layered testing structure
          of ``plone.app.testing`` and will never be testable on travis because they
          don't and will never support Python 2.4.
        
          So we changed primary focus of development to Plone >= 4.0.
          [saily]
        
        - Switchted to ``plone.app.testing`` and added some basic installation tests.
          [saily]
        
        - Add egg-containing buildout and bootstrap.py
          [saily]
        
        - Use ``zcml:condition="installed plone.app.collection"`` to switch to a new
          GS profile which appends prettyphoto views to Collection instead Topic type.
          [saily]
        
        - Refactor GS profiles and depend each profile on a 'extended' profile which
          hold generic stuff as registering css and js. Generic setup takes the first
          profile which is found in folder, so this has to be alpha-sorted behind
          'default'.
          [saily]
        
        
        0.4.5.2 (2012-09-12)
        --------------------
        - more manifest packaging madness
        
        0.4.5.1 (2012-09-12)
        --------------------
        
        - fix bug with sdist packaging
          [jensens]
        
        0.4.5 (2012-09-11)
        ------------------
        
        - corrected the global js-function
          [bennyboy]
        
        - Made it possible to later (i.e. after ajax calls) bind prettyphoto
          to images. thus we have a global js-function plonePrettyPhotoEnable now.
          Also did some housekeeping, added integrated buildout, gitignore, ...
          [jensens]
        
        0.4.4 (2011-12-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Added possiblity to provide custom markup by subclassing the
          view that creates the prettyphoto configuration.
          (see ``browser.view.Javascript.markup``)
          [fRiSi]
        
        0.4.3 (2011-07-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed parameter names used to configure prettyPhoto
          and added autoplay_slideshow.
        
          Previously titles have been shown although ``show_title`` has been set to
          ``False`` in ``prettyphoto_properties``.
          [fRiSi]
        
        - Finish update to 3.1.2 by updating css and images and adding the new `pp_default`
          theme (which is the new default btw ;-)
          [fRiSi]
        
        0.4.2 (2011-07-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgraded to prettyPhoto 3.1.2 and implemented two new properties:
          deeplinking , social_tools
          [petschki]
        
        0.4.1 (2011-03-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgraded to prettyPhoto 3.0.3 .
          This fixes thumbnails in overlay_gallery partly because the regular expression
          now looks for a (jpg|jpeg|png|gif) within the whole url. if your originaly
          linked images are completely without this, they still wont show up.
          [petschki]
        
        - fixed overlay_gallery property defaults to "False"
          [petschki]
        
        0.4.0 (2011-02-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgraded to prettyPhoto library including it's css and image sprite to 3.0.1
          to fix issues with jQuery 1.4.4 (see http://bit.ly/hxYUrt) which is shipped
          with latest Plone 4 by default. This fixes #2.
          [saily]
        
        - Added default thumbnails for 'overlay_galleries' feature.
          [saily]
        
        - Added 'overlay_gallery' and 'slideshow' as additional configuration options
          but disabled by default cause of a bug in jquery.prettyPhoto.js which avoids
          displaying thumbnails not ending on (jpg|jpeg|png|gif).
          See http://bit.ly/eKYdrF
          [saily]
        
        0.3.3 (2010-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed iframe configuration (width was used for height too)
          [fRiSi]
        
        0.3.2 (2010-07-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed install issue with Plone 4 (Large Plone Folder was removed).
          [hpeteragitator]
        
        - Set version in metadata.xml to 1, since this has nothing to do with the package version.
          [tmassman]
        
        0.3.1 (2010-05-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed version numbers and missing upgrade steps.

          [tmassman]
        
        0.3 (2010-05-17)
        ----------------
        
        - Don't fail when installing on sites w/o kupu (plone4 compatibility).
          [fRiSi]
        
        0.2 (2010-01-03)
