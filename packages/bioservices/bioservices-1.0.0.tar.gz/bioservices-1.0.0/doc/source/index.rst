Overview
==========

`BioServices <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bioservices>`_  is a Python package
that provides a framework to easily implement wrapper of Web Services. It focuses on
Biological Web Services based WSDL/SOAP or REST protocols.

The primary goal of BioServices is to use Python as a glue language to provide 
a programmatic access to several Web Services. By doing so, elaboration of 
new applications that combine several of the wrapped Web Services should be
fostered.

One of the main philosophy of **BioServices** is to make use of the
existing SOAP/WSDL facilities provided in biological databases, not to 
re-invent new databases.

There are a lot of Web Services from many institutes; some are free, some are not. The
first release of BioServices provides a wrapping to more than 10 Web
Services. Contributions to implement new wrapper are more than welcome. See
`BioServices wiki <https://www.assembla.com/spaces/bioservices/wiki>`_


Here is a list of services that you can already access from **BioServices**:
