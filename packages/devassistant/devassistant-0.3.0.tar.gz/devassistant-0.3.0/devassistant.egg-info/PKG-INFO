Description: devassistant
        ============
        
        Developer Assistant - start developing with ease.
        
        The devassistant project is a helper for all developers using (not-only) Fedora. It help with creating and setting up basic projects in various languages, installing dependencies, setting up environment etc.
        
        Devassistant is based on idea of per-{language/framework/...} "assistants" with hierarchical structure. E.g. you can run
        
        .. code:: sh
        
          $ devassistant python django -n ~/myproject # sets up Django project named "myproject" inside your home dir
          $ devassistant python flask -n ~/flaskproject # sets up Flask project named "flaskproject" inside your home dir
          $ devassistant java jsf -n ~/alsomyproject # sets up RoR project named "alsomyproject" inside your home dir
