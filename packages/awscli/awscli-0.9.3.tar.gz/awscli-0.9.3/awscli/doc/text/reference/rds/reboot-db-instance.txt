reboot-db-instance
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Reboots a previously provisioned RDS instance. This API results in the
application of modified DBParameterGroup parameters with ApplyStatus
of pending-reboot to the RDS instance. This action is taken as soon as
possible, and results in a momentary outage to the RDS instance during
which the RDS instance status is set to rebooting. If the RDS instance
is configured for MultiAZ, it is possible that the reboot will be
conducted through a failover. A DBInstance event is created when the
reboot is completed.
