Description: Tromegle:  Troll Strangers!
        ========
        Tromegle started as a project through which to learn about HTTP requests and asynchronous I/O.  The idea was
        to learn how to use urllib(2) and later Twisted while having a bit of fun at the expense of a few [Omegle](http://omegle.com) users, or "strangers".
        It has since evolved into an unofficial API, complete with a simple client class.
        
        ###Trolling is a Art!
        The nonstandard functionality of Tromegle is centered around a relatively simple [man-in-the-middle attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
        
        The power of Tromegle lies in the Transmogrifier class, which allows for the conditional modification or injection of AJAX events
        and, by extension, user messages.  In plain English, this means **you can modify the message a user sends to another**
        as well as pass messages that only one user will see!
        
        ###Trolling gently
        Sometimes it's just fun to evesdrop; internet users are often funny despite themselves.  Tromegle gives you the
        tools to either observe or record conversations, or relevant portions thereof.
        
        Getting Tromegle
        ========
        
        You will need python version 2.7 or later to use Tromegle.  2.6 will not work because Tromegle makes extensive use
        of dictionary comprehension syntax -- a feature added in python2.7.  
        
        ###Installing through pip
        
        As of right now, the easiest way to obtain Tromegle is through pip.  Make sure pip is installed prior to running:
        
        ```pip install tromegle --user```
        
        
        ### Installing through Git
        
        ```git clone https://github.com/louist87/tromegle.git```
        
        The package can then be installed withe the following commands:
        ```
        cd tromegle
        sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Dependencies
        ========
        Tromegle is maintained and tested on the latest version of [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/).  It is very likely to
        continue working with older versions, however.
        
        Canonical installation instructions can be found on the above website, but the following installation steps
        should work.
        
        ###Ubuntu (or other Debian-based distro)
        
        ```sudo apt-get install python-twisted```
        
        ###Windows
        
        Download the installer from [here][download]
        
        ###Any OS with pip installed (Mac/Win/*nix)
        
        ```pip install Twisted```
        
        ###OSX
        
        OSX has shipped with Twisted preinstalled since 2007, so Tromegle should work out-of-the-box!  If you have any trouble, you should try [this simple procedure](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#WhyamIgettingImportErrorsforTwistedsubpackagesonOSX10.5).
        If that doesn't work, you can try [downloading the tarball][download] and installing it to a different `PYTHONPATH` than the default.
