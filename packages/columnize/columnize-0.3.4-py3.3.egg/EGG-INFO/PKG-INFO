Description: Return a list of strings as a compact set of columns arranged 
        horizontally or vertically.
        
        For example, for a line width of 4 characters (arranged vertically):
            ['1', '2,', '3', '4'] => '1  3\n2  4\n'
           
        or arranged horizontally:
            ['1', '2,', '3', '4'] => '1  2\n3  4\n'
                
        Each column is only as wide as necessary.  By default, columns are
        separated by two spaces - one was not legible enough. Set "colsep"
        to adjust the string separate columns. Set `displaywidth' to set
        the line width. 
        
        Normally, consecutive items go down from the top to bottom from
        the left-most column to the right-most. If +arrange_vertical+ is
        set false, consecutive items will go across, left to right, top to
        bottom.
