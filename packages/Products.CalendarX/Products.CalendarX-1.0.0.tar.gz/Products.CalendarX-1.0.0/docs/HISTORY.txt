  years from current year instead.

  defaulted to "eventPublished" instead of to classstate, fixed.

  CalendarX from SVN at plone.org.  An egg is in the future.



v0.9.1(alpha)
=============

* Code base: v0.9.0(dev)
* Status:  Alpha release. All tested features work, one outstanding bug
  reported in the tracker (at Plone.org), some minor display bugs
  listed in docs/TODO.txt
* why: 0.9 branch is to introduce Plone 3 compatibility.  Period.
* bugfix: Events with NO category (subject) are shown when you show a calendar
  for the first time (where View All is checked, but none of the other
  categories are checked), but after that it is nearly impossible to display
  events with NO category chosen.  This is an OLD bug.
* thefix: getDictCommon.py: checks to see if xsubALL is in the request and set
  to 'ALL' -- if it is, it sets xsub to 'ALL' before sending xsub to the query.
  Now by default, the View All checkbox WILL display events with NO category
  chosen.  To see ONLY those events with selected categories, you must hit the
  Refresh button when all the categories are selected, but the View All is not
  selected. This makes intuitive sense to me.  View All means ALL (including
  those with NO selected category).
* new: CalendarXFolder.py: Added a new attribute listOfSubCalendarIDs that is
  necessary in order to properly use subcalendars.
* mod: CalendarXFolder.py: Fixed several mislabeled attributes, and changed
  the order of some of them to more closely match the order and descriptions
  in the 0.6.6 release.  Dropped "Topic" from schemata name for subcalendars,
  now is "Sub Calendar Properties".
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: Bugfix.  i18n msgid mislabeled as
  label_sublinks_show_backtoresources changed to
  label_sublinks_backtoresources (around line 475).
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: Bugfix.  Wrapped several more tal:conditions around
  spans to eliminate possible "tuple index out of range" errors coming from
  the python:test() usage. Needed to get the subcalendars working properly.
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: Significant rewriting needed down in the subjectlinks
  macro to get the subcalendars working.  Sheesh.
* mod: getDictCommon.py: checks for nameOfSubCalendar, uses that instead of the
  id if it is available for the header at the top of subcalendars.
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: Bugfix.  useMultiSubjects attribute works fine, but
  if you unchecked it, the subjectlinks macro broke.  Fixed.
* new: CalendarXFolder.py: Added a new attribute listOfReviewStatesDisplayed
  where you can add other review states (such as 'pending' or 'external') and
  these will be appended onto the other states to display in your calendar.
* mod: getEventsBeforeZC.py, getEventsBetweenZC.py, getEventsBeforeAQ.py,
  getEventsBetweenAQ.py: modified the review_state query to accommodate the
  new listOfReviewStatesDisplayed attribute.
* mod: CalendarXFolder.py: TYPO, bugfix: memberSubfolderPath attribute in the
  Add Event Link Properties schemata was misspelled as memberSubFolderPath.
  Also updated the description to point out that if there is no member home
  folder, but this attribute is selected, then it will default back to a
  folder of this name but in the PORTAL ROOT, not in a member home folder.
* mod: getAddNewEventURL.py: bugfix.  There is no member home folder now by
  default, and so the call to getHomeUrl() returned None, but was not
  trapped for that.  Now it is, and so if there is no member home folder, but
  this attribute is selected, then it will default back to a folder of this
  name but in the PORTAL ROOT, not in a member home folder.
* new: added i18n/calendarx-sv.po file, contributed over a year ago by Martin
  Eliasson.  I added (probably very wrongly) a guestimate of the translation
  of "manage" for the new manage tab, which didn't exist when Martin
  originally sent this to me.


v0.9.0(dev)
===========

* Code base: v0.6.6(stable)
* Status:  Pre-alpha dev release. Seems to work, at least enough to test.
* why: 0.9 branch is to introduce Plone 3 compatibility.  Period.
* mod: CalendarXFolder.py: Much reworking here to convert it to Archetypes.
  Pushed all the CX_props sheets into schemata (the hard work of this was
  done by folks at the PSU CalendarX Patch Sprint in Dec 2007 and checked
  into the Collective as the /plone3-compatibility branch).  I added the
  CSS properties to finish it.  Also fixed default from False to 0 for
  earlyDayEventHour attribute, which fixed some day and weekbyhour view
  errors.
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: Bugfix.  i18n bug shows up in Plone 3 because having
  tal:content and an i18n string together produces a conflict.  Now only has
  i18n call (around line 472).
* mod: weekbyhour.pt: Bugfix.  Found that the i18n for the bottom day titles
  was incompletely setup, causing them to remain i18n-less.  Line 245 call
  to display month was missing a suffix '_3'.  Fixed.
* mod: weekbyday.css: Bugfix.  Removed CSS rule for TD class="hour" that was
  both wrong and superfluous (no such usage in the weekbyday template).
* new: showDefaultView.py.  This simple script simply redirects to the view
  specified in the defaultView attribute.  Used when you head toward the
  calendar without adding /month or /day or whatever view you want at the end.
* mod: CalendarXFolder.py: added aliases to point default view to the new
  showDefaultView.py redirector script.
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: added a "manage" tab that gives easy access to
  editing the calendar properties.  only shows up for logged-in users with
  "Manage portal content" permission for the calendar instance.
* mod: po files, added "label_managetab" msgid and (my own, doubtful)
  translations for each language, except for Japanese (I didn't translate
  that one).  Write me with better ones, or better yet, check them into
  svn at the collective and email me that you've done so.
* mod: CX_props_macros.pt: Something has changed, probably in Zope 2.10 or
  possibly more recent Python versions.  I used to be able to do this
  ``tal:content="python:test(usesubtitles,subtitles[n-1],`subby)"``
  and it would NOT evaluate subtitles[n-1] unless usesubtitles was True.
  However, now it throws a tuple index out of range error, even if
  usesubtitles is False. So I'm reworking all the tal:content calls
  that use this sort of testing.  The main ones are fixed, allowing us
  to use the Subject Bar again :-).
* still to do: fix more darned tuple index errors... I'm not seeing any of them
  show up, but I know that the code doesn't have the checks that it needs yet.
* still to do: fix the damned mouseover highlighting errors
* still to do: Possible problems with restrictToThisListOfSubjects, where View
  All categories highlights all subjects, but doesn't then display events with
  subject other than those checked, or does if it isn't restricted?  Check pls.
* still to do: find the other po files given to me long ago, and put them in.
  Don't forget the "label_managetab" msgid.
* still to do: explore the new /tests added by the Sprinters.  I haven't learned
  the use of testing in Plone yet, although I did learn it this summer in
  some other systems.  I'll get to that next and maybe soon we'll actually have
  a meaningful test suite for CalendarX!
