        About
        -----
        
        fcache is a simple, persistent, file-based cache module for Python. It uses `pickle <http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_ to store objects into a cache file and `appdirs <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/appdirs>`_ to ensure that cache files are stored in platform-appropriate, application-specific directories. It supports optional, time-based data expiration.
        
        It's Simple
        -----------
        
        ::
        
            >>> import fcache
            >>> cache = fcache.Cache("population", "statistics-fetcher")
            >>> cache.set("chicago", 9729825)
            >>> print cache.get("chicago")
            9729825
        
        Using fcache is as simple as creating a ``Cache`` object, setting data, and getting data back.
        
        It's Persistent
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
            >>> exit()
            $ python
            >>> import fcache
            >>> cache = fcache.Cache("population", "statistics-fetcher")
            >>> print cache.get("chicago")
            9729825
        
        Cached data doesn't disappear when you stop using a ``Cache`` object. When you create a new object with the same arguments, your data is still there, just like you left it.
        
        It's File-Based
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
            >>> print cache.filename
            /Users/tsr/Library/Caches/statistics-fetcher/248081ecb337c85ec8e4330e6099625a
        
        Cached data is stored in a file, plain and simple. You can see it on the file system. You can delete it, copy it, or write your own library to open it.
        
        It's Time-Aware
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
            >>> import time
            >>> cache.set("chicago", 9729825, 30)
            >>> print cache.get("chicago")
            9729825
            >>> time.sleep(30)
            >>> print cache.get("chicago")
            None
        
        Just like an orange, some data goes bad after awhile. fcache can keep track of when data should expire.
