Amazon Simple Queue Service
***************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly
scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between
computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data
between distributed components of their applications that perform
different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component
to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to build an automated
workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web services.

Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon's web-scale messaging
infrastructure as a web service. Any computer on the Internet can add
or read messages without any installed software or special firewall
configurations. Components of applications using Amazon SQS can run
independently, and do not need to be on the same network, developed
with the same technologies, or running at the same time.
