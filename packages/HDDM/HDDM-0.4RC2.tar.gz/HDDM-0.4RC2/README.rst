Purpose
=======

HDDM is a python toolbox for hierarchical Bayesian parameter
estimation of the Drift Diffusion Model (via PyMC). Drift Diffusion
Models are used widely in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to
study decision making.

Features
========

* Uses hierarchical Bayesian estimation (via PyMC) of DDM parameters
  to allow simultaneous estimation of subject and group parameters,
  where individual subjects are assumed to be drawn from a group
  distribution. HDDM should thus produce better estimates when less RT
  values are measured compared to other methods using maximum
  likelihood for individual subjects (i.e. `DMAT`_ or `fast-dm`_).

* Heavily optimized likelihood functions for speed (Navarro & Fuss, 2009).

* Flexible creation of complex models tailored to specific hypotheses
  (e.g. estimation of separate drift-rates for different task
  conditions; or predicted changes in model parameters as a function
  of other indicators like brain activity).

* Easy specification of models via configuration file fosters exchange
  of models and research results.

* Built-in Bayesian hypothesis testing and several convergence and
  goodness-of-fit diagnostics.

Usage
=====

Command line
------------

The easiest way to use HDDM is by creating a configuration file for your model:

example.conf
::

    [depends]
    v = difficulty

Then call hddm_fit.py:

::

    hddm_fit.py --samples 10000 --burn 5000 example.conf mydata.csv

Python
------

Of course, you can also use HDDM directly from within Python:

::

   import hddm

   # Load data from csv file into a NumPy structured array
   data = hddm.load_csv('simple_difficulty.csv')

   # Create a HDDM model multi object
   model = hddm.HDDM(data, depends_on={'v':'difficulty'})

   # Create model and start MCMC sampling
   model.sample(10000, burn=5000)

   # Print fitted parameters and other model statistics
   model.print_stats()

   # Plot posterior distributions and theoretical RT distributions
   model.plot_posteriors()
   model.plot_posterior_predictive(savefig=True)


Installing
==========

See further below on how to install most of the necessary
dependencies for the most common platforms.

Assuming you have the dependencies, the easiest way to install HDDM is
via pip ::

    pip install kabuki
    pip install hddm

If you already installed a previous version of HDDM, you should
upgrade instead ::

   pip install --upgrade --no-deps kabuki
   pip install --upgrade --no-deps hddm



Dependencies
============

HDDM relies on the following packages:

* Python

* NumPy

* PyMC_ (installation instructions: http://pymc.googlecode.com/svn/doc/installation.html)

* kabuki_

* SciPy (optional)

* Matplotlib (optional)

* Cython_ (optional)


Windows
-------

The easiest way is to download and install the `Enthought Python
Distribution`_ (EPD) which is free for academic use. An untested
alternative is the Python(x,y) distribution. Please let us know your
experiences if you test this option.

We recommend using pip to download and install HDDM. The easiest way
to install pip is via easy_install. Start the windows command shell
(cmd.exe) and type ::

    easy_install pip


Linux (Debian based, such as Ubuntu)
------------------------------------

Most of HDDM's dependencies are available from your repository, you can install them by typing

::

    apt-get install python python-dev python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib cython python-pip gfortran liblapack-dev

which requires sudo rights.

Optional dependencies for hddm_demo.py can be installed via

::

    apt-get install python-wxgtk2.8 python-traitsui

OSX
---

We recommend installing the `SciPy Superpack`_ maintained by Chris Fonnesbeck.

The Superpack requires you to install XCode which apparently does not bundle with gcc anymore (which is required by HDDM). This repository provides some appropriate installers:

Psychology, 65, 2011
