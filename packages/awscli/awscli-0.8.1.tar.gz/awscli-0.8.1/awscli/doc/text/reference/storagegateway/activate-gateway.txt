activate-gateway
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation activates the gateway you previously deployed on your
VMware host. For more information, see Downloading and Deploying AWS
Storage Gateway VM . In the activation process you specify information
such as the region you want to use for storing snapshots, the time
zone for scheduled snapshots and the gateway schedule window, an
activation key, and a name for your gateway. The activation process
also associates your gateway with your account (see  update-gateway-
information ).

Note: You must power on the gateway VM before you can activate your
  gateway.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws storagegateway activate-gateway
     --activation-key <value>
     --gateway-timezone <value>
     --gateway-region <value>
     --gateway-name <value>
     [--gateway-type <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--activation-key"  (string)
   Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by
   sending an HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway
   IP address (port 80). The redirect URL returned in the response
   provides you the activation key for your gateway in the query
   string parameter "activationKey" . It may also include other
   activation-related parameters, however, these are merely defaults
   -- the arguments you pass to the "activate-gateway" API call
   determine the actual configuration of your gateway.

"--gateway-timezone"  (string)
   One of the values that indicates the time zone you want to set for
   the gateway. The time zone is used, for example, for scheduling
   snapshots and your gateway's maintenance schedule.

"--gateway-region"  (string)
   One of the values that indicates the region where you want to store
   the snapshot backups. The gateway region specified must be the same
   region as the region in your "Host" header in the request. For more
   information about available regions and endpoints for AWS Storage
   Gateway, see Regions and Endpoints in the **Amazon Web Services
   Glossary** .

   *Valid Values* : "us-east-1", "us-west-1", "us-west-2", "eu-
   west-1", "ap-northeast-1", "ap-southest-1", "sa-east-1"

"--gateway-name"  (string)


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--gateway-type"  (string)
   One of the values that defines the type of gateway to activate. The
   type specified is critical to all later functions of the gateway
   and cannot be changed after activation. The default value is
   "STORED" .
