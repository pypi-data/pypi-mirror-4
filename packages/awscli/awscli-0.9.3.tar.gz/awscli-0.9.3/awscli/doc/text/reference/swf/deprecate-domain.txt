deprecate-domain
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deprecates the specified domain. After a domain has been deprecated it
cannot be used to create new workflow executions or register new
types. However, you can still use visibility actions on this domain.
Deprecating a domain also deprecates all activity and workflow types
registered in the domain. Executions that were started before the
domain was deprecated will continue to run.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the domain --name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
