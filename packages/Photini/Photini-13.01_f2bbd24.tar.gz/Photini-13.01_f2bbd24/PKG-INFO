Description: 
        Photini is a GUI program to create and edit metadata for digital
        photographs. It can set textual information such as title, description
        and copyright as well as geolocation information by browsing a map or
        setting coordinates directly. It reads metadata in EXIF, IPTC or XMP
        format and writes it to all three, to maximise compatibility with
        other software.
