Plone Keyword Manager
=====================

Plone Keyword Manager allows you to change, merge and delete
keywords (aka tags or subjects) in Plone and updates all corresponding objects 
automatically. It uses a similiarity search to support you in identifying 
similar keywords. PloneKeywordManager helps you to build an inductive 
vocabulary with several people working on the same Plone site. Keywords can be 
cleaned up from time to time by a site-manager to create a consistent 
vocabulary.

Plone Keyword Manager is a quite simple solution to a major problem in the real
world use of Plone: If you can't work with restricted vocbularies, your
keyword-vocabulary will get duplicate entries very quickly - depending on your
authors' interpretation of existing keywords.

Installation
============

In your buildout add ``Products.PloneKeywordManager`` to your instances eggs 
section. Run buildout. Activate it at Site Setups Add Ons page.

Usage
=====

After installing, you will find an entry in Site Setup a section called 
Keyword Manager. Inside, you will see an alphabetical listing and a selection 
for all keywords existing in your site.

Use the last one to see similar terms for a single keyword.
Use the former one if you want to see a list of all keywords starting with
letter 'b', click it. The Plone Keyword Manager will then search all keywords
starting with 'b' and will also look for similar keywords. You can now select
several keywords and delete them for example. If you only want to change a single
keyword, select it, then enter the new keyword and click on merge. If you want to
merge several keywords into one new one, select them, enter the new keyword
and click on merge.

The last selected keyword is entered automatically into the textbox if JavaScript
is enabled. This may be irritating at first glance, but you'll learn to appreciate
quite fast. If you use it the right way, you don't have to copy&paste into the
textbox. Try it yourself, you'll get the idea behind it...

For developer and integrator
============================

You can also use KeywordManager to import your keywords with genericsetup. Just
add a ``keywords.txt`` in your profile with one keyword per line. This step add or
update a Document with an id to 'keywords'. Let it in private state so only
the administrator will be able to manage it.
