Description: 
        Hence name: WEB Quick RESPonse.
        
        Usage::
        
            sudo pip install webqresp
            webqresp http://example.com/
            webqresp --repeat=3 --start=5 --response-seconds=0.5 --header='X-Name: Value' --content='{"name": "value"}' --method=POST http://example.com/some/page
        
        * ``--repeat`` - Number of times to repeat the test, showing aggregated stats in the end. Default: ``1``.
        * ``--start`` - Number of concurrent requests to start with. Default: ``1``.
        * ``--response-seconds`` - Maximal response time in seconds for each request to pass the test. Default: ``1``.
        * ``--header`` - Additional headers, e.g. ``--header='Content-Type: application/json' --header='X-Name: Value'``.
        * ``--content`` - Content for ``POST``, etc. E.g. ``'name1=value1&name2=value2'`` or ``'{"name1": "value1", "name2": "value2"}'``.
        * ``--method`` - HTTP Method. Default: ``GET``.
        * ``url`` - URL to test, e.g. ``http://example.com/some/page``.
        
        Criterion:
        
            Maximal number of concurrent requests to the slowest URL
            while each request gets successful response within a second.
        
        Why:
        
        * Popular criterion Requests Per Second (RPS, req/s) has a great flaw of being confusing when comparing measurement before and after optimization. Please see `explanation <http://www.therailsway.com/2009/1/6/requests-per-second/>`_.
        * Another criterion - Milliseconds Per Request (ms/req) calculated as 1000/(req/s) as proposed in the article above also has flaws:
            * It shows real response duration experienced by a user only when requests are sent sequentially, not concurrently:
                * Let's take 100,000 requests and send them to a server in a sequence, waiting for each response before sending the next request. If server processes all this in 10 seconds, it is giving 10,000 req/s, and each request gets response in 0.1 ms - great!
                * Now let's send 100,000 requests at the same time, not waiting for responses. If server processes all this in 10 seconds, it is giving the same 10,000 req/s, however while this criterion still shows false 0.1 ms, each request may get response in up to 10 seconds - that is not acceptable.
            * It still keeps proportion ambiguity:
                * Let's take 10,000 req/s == 0.1 ms/req == 10,000 concurrent requests with 1 second for each response - this is acceptable.
                * The same 10,000 req/s == 0.1 ms/req == 100,000 requests with 10 seconds for each response - this is not acceptable.
        * Our criterion is constructed so that:
            * It cares about real response duration for each user in the worst concurrent case.
            * It is not a proportion. It is not ambiguous. Once 1 second is reached or failure occurs, it stops incrementing concurrent requests and returns the result.
        * Single slowest URL is chosen to save time configuring the tool, because anyway "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link".
