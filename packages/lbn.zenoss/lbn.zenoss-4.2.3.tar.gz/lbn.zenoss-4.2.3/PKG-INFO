Description: lbn.zenoss
        ----------
        
        Zenoss is still a decidedly arcane user of the Zope application server
        environment and particularly in the adoption of extensible Component
        Architecture concepts.
        
        Also, the concept of a ZenPack is rather twisted and we're providing
        infrastructure here to provide additional shims to treat these as
        plain python eggs.
        
        This package also contains the basis for efforts to deploy Zenoss using
        buildout and friends.
