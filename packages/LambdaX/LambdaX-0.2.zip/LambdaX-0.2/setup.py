    LambdaX is a composition class. It's a lambda replacement which is shorter, pickle-able, and cooler.

    LambdaX has two main features:

    It acts as an identity function ( so X(object) == object, etc. )
    When performing operations on it, it returns a new class that acts as a corresponding function.

    Example:
        >>> map( X+2, [1, 2, 3] )
        [3, 4, 5]

        >>> head, tail = X[0], X[1:]
        >>> (head(tail))([1,2,3])
