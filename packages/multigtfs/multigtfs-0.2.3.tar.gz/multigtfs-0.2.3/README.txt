django-multi-gtfs - The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) in Django

Developed for the Tulsa Web Dev's project to get Tulsa's buses into Google
Maps.  Allows storage of multiple independent GTFS feeds, for combining or
versioning.

To run app tests:
* Create a virtualenv (I recommend virtualenvwrapper)
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* ./qa_check.sh

See http://tulsawebdevs.org for more information about the project.
