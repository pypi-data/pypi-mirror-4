Collaborating
=============

FireWorks is an open-source codebase, and one if its advantages is the possibility for community contribution and improvement. If you are interested in contributing code to FireWorks, we'd be very happy to have you join the team! As a contributor, your code will be available to the entire FireWorks community, and your name will be added to our list of :doc:`here </contributors>`.

However, at the same time, we must note that not all community improvements to FireWorks can be merged into the main FireWorks repo. Therefore, we suggest that you first read through our Contributing Guidelines before submitting code contributions.
