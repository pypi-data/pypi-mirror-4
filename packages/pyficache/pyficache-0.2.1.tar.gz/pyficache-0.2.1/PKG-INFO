Description: A - pyficache module to read and cache information about a Python program. 
        
        SYNOPSIS
        
        The pyficache module allows one to get any line from any file, caching
        lines of the file on first access to the file. Although the file may
        be any file, the common use is when the file is a Python script since
        parsing of the file is done to figure out where the statement
        boundaries are.
        
        The routines here may be is useful when a small random sets of lines
        are read from a single file, in particular in a debugger to show
        source lines.
        
        Summary
        
          import pyficache
          lines = pyficache.getlines('/tmp/myprogram.py')
          line = pyficache.getline('/tmp/myprogram.py', 6)
          # Note lines[6] == line if /tmp/myprogram.py has more 6 or more lines
        
          pyficache.clear_file_cache()
          pyficache.clear_file_cache('/tmp/myprogram.py')
          pyficache.update_cache()   # Check for modifications of all cached files.

          This is a port of the my Ruby linecache module which in turn is 
          based on the Python linecache module. So in a sense this is decorator
          and extension of that.
        
          coverage.py provides the cool stuff to figure out lines where there
          statements.
