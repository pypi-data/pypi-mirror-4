PyCPX is a python wrapper for the CPlex Optimization Suite that
focuses on speed, ease of use, and seamless integration with numpy.
CPlex is a powerful solver for linear and quadratic programs over
real, linear, and boolean variables.  PyCPX allows one to naturally
express such programs using numpy and natural python constructs.

PyCPX requires IBM's `ILog Concert Technology`_ Suite, which is
available for free under IBM's Academic Initiative program or as part
of the CPlex Optimization Suite.
