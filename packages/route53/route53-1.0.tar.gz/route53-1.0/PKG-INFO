        :Info: A Python 2.7/3.x compatible Route53 module.
        :Author: Greg Taylor
        
        The ``python-route53`` Python package is a simple Python 3 compatible API for
        Amazon's `Route 53`_.
        
        Why not boto?
        -------------
        
        boto_ is a wonderful piece of software, one that I continue to contribute to.
        However, we needed a Python 3 compatible route53 module, and boto has a long
        way to go on this front.
        
        I've also taken what I feel is a more simple, minimalistic API design. That
        is entirely subjective, though, and boto is perfectly viable.
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Head on over and read the documentation_.
        
        Current status
        --------------
        
        Beta, but generally useful to anyone. Great unit test coverage, good
        documentation_.
