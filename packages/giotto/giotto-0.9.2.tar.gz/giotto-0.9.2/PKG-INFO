        What is Giotto?
        ===============
        
        Giotto is a python web framework. It encourages a functional style where model, view and controller code is strongly decoupled.
        
        Key Features of Giotto include:
        
        * "Your code calls the framework" style over "Framework calls your code" style
        * Generic views, generic models and multiple pluggable controllers
        * Functional CRUD patterns that do away with the need for django-style form objects.
        * Automatic URL routing
        * Extensible functionality
        * Built in cache (supports Redis and Memcache, and an API for supporting any other engines)
        * SQLAlchemy for database persistence
        * Jinja2 for HTML templates (with an API for extending for other template engines)
