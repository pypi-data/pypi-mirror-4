You can use the "require_version" function in mygpoclient to require a minimum
version of the mygpoclient library. The "require_version" function has been
added in version 1.3, so you have to check (e.g. with hasattr) if mygpoclient
has got a "require_version" attribute. You can then do the version check like
this:

if not hasattr(mygpoclient, 'require_version') or \
        not mygpoclient.require_version('1.3'):
    # Show error message and tell user to upgrade to version 1.3

The parameter signature for the EpisodeAction constructor has been updated.
It now contains not only the optional "position" argument, but two new
arguments as well. The order of these parameters is:

  started
  position
  total

If one of "started" or "total" is set, "position" becomes mandatory. This
means that the following combinations are now possible:

  None
  position
  position and started
  position and total
  position and started and total

Also, the format has been changed. Instead of having a "HH:MM:SS" timestamp
format, we now only accept integer values (the number of seconds).
