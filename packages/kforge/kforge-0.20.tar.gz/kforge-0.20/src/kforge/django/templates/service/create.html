<h2>Add new service</h2>

Adding project services helps people to use and contribute to your project.

<form action="." method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>
      Service details
    </legend>

    <label for="id_plugin">Plugin <strong>*</strong></label><br />
    {{ form.plugin }}
    <p class="desc">The plugin determines what kind of application will be made available at the service url. So, for example, if you choose 'svn' you will get a Subversion repository, if you choose 'moin' you will get a MoinMoin wiki. 
    </p>
    <p class="desc">Note that the type of service cannot be changed after the service has been created. If you would like a different type of service, simply create another service of a different type, and then delete the unwanted service.</p>

    <label for="id_name">Name <strong>*</strong></label><br />
    {{ form.name }}
    <p class="desc">The name has several restrictions because it is used to locate your service (in links). The service name:</p>
    <ul class="desc">
      <li>cannot match the name of any other service in your project</li>
      <li>can only contain alphanumeric, underscore and hyphen characters</li>
    </ul>
