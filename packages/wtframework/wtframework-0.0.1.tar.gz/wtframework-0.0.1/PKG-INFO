Description: Wiredrive Web Test Framework
        ======
        https://github.com/wiredrive/WD-WTF
        
        
        Wiredrive Web Test Framework (referred to as WTF for short) provides a 
        structured testing framework for testing a Web Application using nose unit 
        test framework and Selenium Webdriver. 
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Installation via PYPI
        
        	pip install wiredrive-wtf
        
        
        Setting up your project
        =======================
        
        Run the following command to initialize an empty project structure for a WTF test.
        	
        	wtf_init.py YourProjectName
        
        Next you'll need to setup your python path.
        
        	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/project/tests
        	
        Now the directory structure and your python path is setup so nosetests can run tests 
        you write in the WTF framework.
        
        
        Running your tests
        ==================
        
        Run your tests using nosetests.
        
        	./runtests.py
