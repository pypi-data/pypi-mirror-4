Description: appypi: sandboxing apps from Pypi packages
        ==========================================
        
        **appypi** is a terminal-based `Python Package
        Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ package manager. Each app
        installed through appypi is sandboxed in an individual virtualenv and
        usable from the user space. No root access is required to install an
        app. appypi in **NOT** a replacement for
        `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ or
        `easy\_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_.
        Actually, it uses pip intensively to manage package installations.
        
        appypi creates launchers into the user ~/bin directory. These launchers
        mimic the package behavior in terms of what commands can be called. For
        example, appypi will create a *django-admin.py* launcher when installing
        the `django <http://djangoproject.com/>`_ package, and a *fab* launcher
        when installing the `Fabric <http://fabfile.org/>`_ package. This way,
        you can use the package as if it was installed with pip directly.
        
        appypi won't install a package if it finds it in your path already. It
        is your duty to take care of these external installations before using
        appypi.
        
        Installing a package:
        
        ::
        
            $ appypi install django
            Looking for django...
            Found Django version 1.4.2
            Installing...
            Install successful!
        
        Upgrading a package:
        
        ::
        
            $ appypi upgrade django
            Upgrading: Django (1.3 => 1.4.2)
        
        Removing a package:
        
        ::
        
            $ appypi remove django
            These packages will be REMOVED:
        
                Django
        
            Do you want to continue? [y/n]y
