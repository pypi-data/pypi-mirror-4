describe-services
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service
categories that applies to each one. You then use service names and
categories in your create-case requests. Each AWS service has its own
set of categories.

The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that are
displayed in the **Service** and **Category** drop-down lists on the
AWS Support Center Open a new case page. The values in those fields,
however, do not necessarily match the service codes and categories
returned by the "describe-services" request. Always use the service
codes and categories obtained programmatically. This practice ensures
that you always have the most recent set of service and category
codes.
