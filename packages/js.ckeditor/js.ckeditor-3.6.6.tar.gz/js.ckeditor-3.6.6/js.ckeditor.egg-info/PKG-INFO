        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `CKEditor`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`CKEditor`: http://ckeditor.com
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.ckeditor``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``ckeditor`` from ``js.ckeditor`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.ckeditor import ckeditor
          >>> ckeditor.need()
