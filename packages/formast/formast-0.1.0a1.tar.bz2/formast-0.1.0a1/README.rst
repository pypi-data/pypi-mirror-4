FormAST exposes file format descriptions through a simple API.

FormAST stands for *file format abstract syntax tree*.
Its primary purpose is to expose the abstract syntax tree
of a file format description.

The library is still in alpha stage, and is not yet ready for
production use. The API is still subject to discussion and might
change drastically in future releases.
