        THeBoPS - Tobias Herp's Bag of Python Stuff
        ~~~~~~~---~------~~-----~---~--~------~----
        
        This is a collection of Python modules I created over the years and improved
        every now and then, while programming for fun at home.  Since I consider them
        useful and like them a lot, I wanted to have them at work, too, and thus
        created this package.
        
        Contained modules are:
        
        anyos.py
          Tries to help when developing portable programs; includes a find_progs
          function which helps e.g. a suitable *X "find" executable on Windows(tm)
          systems (if there is one installed); see thebops.likeix below.
        
        colours.py
          Collects information about HTML, CSS, SVG colours
        
        counters.py
          A module to help count whatever you want, including different types of
          errors, warnings etc.
        
        enhopa.py
          The "enhanced option parser".
          The optparse/optik module is quite cool.  Some consider it outdated because
          of the newer argparse module; but argparse can't do everything optparse can
          (and vice versa), and thus both have their uses.
          The enhopa module does some minor tweaks to optparse; perhaps I'll replace it
          one day by a new thebops.optparse module which is done as I like it to be.
          See thebops.opo as well, which (of course) doesn't care whether optparse or
          thebops.enhopa is used.
        
        errors.py
          An error handling module for console programs. To count the errors as well,
          use the thebops.counters module.
        
        iscales.py
          Collects information about image scales and their names
        
        likeix.py
          Collects knowledge how to find certain *X conforming tools on Windows systems
          (but of course on *X as well, where they should be present in the PATH),
          using the find_progs function from thebops.anyos.
        
        modinfo.py
          A module which allows Python modules to tell about themselves
        
        opo.py
          optparse options:  A collection of often used optparse option definitions,
          including some which use callback functions.
        
        rexxbi.py
          "REXX builtins"; some functions which are built-in in the scripting language
          REXX by Mike Cowlishaw, re-implemented in Python.
          See rexxbi_demo.
        
        shtools.py
          Some utiltities for console programs, e.g. an "ask" function which
          understands choices specifications like "yes,sure:1;no,nope:0;always;never";
          see shtools_demo.
        
        termwot.py
          This is "Tobias Herp's Terminal Waste of Time".  Not very useful, but helps
          to make console programs a little bit more fun.
          See termwot_demo.
