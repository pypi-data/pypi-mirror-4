Hi ${user.first_name}

We are proud to announce a new feature of Yith Library: periodic email backups directly delivered to your inbox!

With this feature you will receive a copy of your passwords collection in your email once a month.

We have enabled this feature by default but if you don't like it you can disable it in your preferences at ${preferences_link}
