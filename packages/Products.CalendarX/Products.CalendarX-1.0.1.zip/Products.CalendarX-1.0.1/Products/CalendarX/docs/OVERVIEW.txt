Pretty current summary of CalendarX functionality
=================================================

* Plone 3 compatible
* i18n: English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Danish, Czech,
  Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese-Brazilian and Swedish are the current
  translations, others to follow as contributed.
* Calendar views validate as proper XHTML 1.0 Transitional (at w3c.org).
* Provides basic calendar functionality with standard Plone content (CMFEvents,
  AT Events, custom AT events when registered in CalendarX properties).
* Multimonth, Month, Week by day, Week by hour, Day views available.
* Metacalendar: Categorize your Events using the Subject attribute standard on
  all Plone events.  Choose categories in a bar just below the View tabs.
  Change subjects in portal_metadata tool.  Choose between ONE subject at a
  time, or MULTIPLE subjects at one time.
* Many configuration options available through use of AT properties, including
  decoration of the calendar, decoration of events by Subject or Type, putting
  restrictions on the type, location or subject of events shown, etc.
* Day and WeekByHour views can be easily managed to display fractional days:
  from 8am to 6pm, for example.  Hours displayed on these can be set to
  12 or 24 hour formats.  Hours or half-hour periods can be displayed.
* Late events (after midnight) can be shown on the "later events" portion of
  the day and weekbyhour views, or shown as early events on those views,
  being configured with a simple property to set the hour that separates them.
  These are NOT used with the other views, just day and weekbyhour views.
* Multiple calendars can be created within one Plone site.  Also any python
  scripts, javascripts, CSS files can be uniquely customized for any one
  calendar.
* Subcalendars - nested calendars and modifications to the Subject links
  that allow busy calendars to be subdivided beyond just Subject usage.  Good
  for school calendars, Resource scheduling (equipment reservations), etc.
* Private calendars: All your users automatically have a private calendar, if
  they so choose.  They can just add Events and set them to "private" status,
  and then only they can see them on their calendar.
* "Add New Event" link, with customizable destination folders depending on
  user and/or Roles.
* Customize a "calendar help" page for your newbie users.  Help appears as a
  tab, if you choose to make it available, and is customizable.
* Installs as a normal Plone Product, addable as Plone content.
* No Dependencies: Only needs Plone standard products.  Will use Dieter's
  ManagableIndex and AdvancedQuery products if desired.  Or not.
* Prints nicely from most browsers (using a special CSS sheet for printing).



Planned features for future branches
====================================

* Group calendar support (minimal support now available).
* Repeat events.
* iCal export and import.  Does export now, sorta, if you use ATCT Events.
  But we'd like full calendar export that supports the other options you've
  chosen, like how you've filtered your events for display.

CalendarX builds on a proud tradition of other Zope/Plone products, and gathers
strength through the tremendous efforts of its users (see CREDITS.txt).
