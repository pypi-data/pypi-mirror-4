Description: # barpy #
        
        This is Python a port of [barby][] library written in Ruby. I couldn't find
        lightweight Python barcode generation library of the same caliber as **barby**
        ([elaphe][] is broken and others don't support GS1-128 *and* QRCode at the same
        time, so I ported **barby**.

        [elaphe]: http://code.google.com/p/elaphe/
        
        API is basicly the same as of **barby**, but in Python style.
        
        The port is very quick and not complete at the moment (I ported only parts
        I really need for my project), I will port the rest eventually.
        
        Also the port is quite direct, in a sense there are a lot of places in Python
        code which have more Rubyish flavour instead of Pythonian (e.g. a lot of
        `@property` decorators to call methods without parenthesis). I did it to avoid
        logic errors during porting process, I will make code more Pythonian in the
        future.
