        Simple Python VFS library
        -------------------------
        
        PyVFS is a simple pure Python VFS library. It consists of
        several layers, allowing to use different low-level protocol
        implementations. Now you can choose between 9p (9p2000.u)
        and FUSE (you should have python-py9p or python-fuse
        installed)
        
        ObjectFS
        ++++++++
        
        ObjectFS (``pyvfs.objectfs``) is a library that allows you
        to export your Python objects on a dynamic filesystem.
        ObjectFS integration is extremely simple and engages only
        the decorator import and usage. The developer should not
        care about almost any of fs-related issues. Objects of the
        decorated classes will automatically appear as file trees
        on a dynamic filesystem with read/write access.
        
        PyVFS
        +++++
        
        Also you can write your own applications with PyVFS. E.g.,
        one can utilize file I/O as an RPC interface, or use a
        dynamic filesystem for runtime service configuration.
