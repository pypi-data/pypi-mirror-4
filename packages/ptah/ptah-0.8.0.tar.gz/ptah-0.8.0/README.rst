Ptah
====

Ptah is a fast, fun, open source high-level Python web development environment. Ptah is built on top of the Pyramid web framework.  Ptah's goal is to make developing interactive web sites and applications fun.  Ptah aims to fill a void in the Pyramid eco-system, a "full stack" environment which is well integrated and provides opinions (forms, management ui, models, etc).

Ptah is loosely affiliated with the Pyramid, Django, Drupal and Zope/Plone communities.  

Most documentation requires Ptah 0.3 or greater.

You can read the `ptah` documentation on-line at 
`http://ptahproject.readthedocs.org <http://ptahproject.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_.
