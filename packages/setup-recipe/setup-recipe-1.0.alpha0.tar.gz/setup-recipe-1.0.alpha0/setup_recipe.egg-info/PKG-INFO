Description: =====================
        Setup Buildout Recipe
        =====================
        
        Runs the ``setup.py`` in all specified directories, using custom interpreter, e.g. the one generated by zc.buildout.egg
        recipe. Its intended be used to run any commands that require libraries (eggs) from buildout.
        Any additional command line arguments are passed to the ``setup.py``. Setup is always run in working directory where it
        resides.
        
        Parameters
        
        * use-interpreter - Name of python interpreter to use.
        * develop - List of directories, where ``setup.py`` files reside. Typically ``${buildout:develop}`` to list all developed apps.
        * command - Command line argument for the ``setup.py``. Optional.
        
        Typical buildout.cfg snippet::
        
            [python]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            interpreter = python
            eggs = ${buildout:eggs}
        
            [test]
            recipe = setup-recipe
            use-interpreter = ${python:interpreter}
            develop = ${buildout:develop}
            command = test
        
        Running ``./bin/test`` will then run ``./bin/python setup.py test`` for every developed project.
