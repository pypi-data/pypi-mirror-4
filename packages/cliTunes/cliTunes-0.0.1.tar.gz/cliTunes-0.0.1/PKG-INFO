        =========
        
        For now, this is just a command-line interface to iTunes. It's pretty
        simple, but I am considering making it do a lot of more interesting
        things as time goes by.
        
        It's not in pip, because working with PyPi is a horrible experience that
        I will worry about some other time.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Put bin/clitunes somewhere in your path. Now, you can do things like this:
        
            clitunes play
            clitunes pause
            clitunes stop
