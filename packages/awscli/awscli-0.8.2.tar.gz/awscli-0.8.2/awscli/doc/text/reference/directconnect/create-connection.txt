create-connection
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new network connection between the customer network and a
specific AWS Direct Connect location.

A connection links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect
location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic
cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to
an AWS Direct Connect router. A Direct Connect location provides
access to Amazon Web Services in the region it is associated with. You
can establish connections with AWS Direct Connect locations in
multiple regions, but a connection in one region does not provide
connectivity to other regions.
