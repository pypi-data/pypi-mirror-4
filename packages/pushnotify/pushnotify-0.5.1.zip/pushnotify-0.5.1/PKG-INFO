Description: ==========
        pushnotify
        ==========
        
        pushnotify is a package for sending push notifications. It currently
        supports Android devices running Notify My Android and Pushover, and iOS
        devices running Pushover and Prowl.
        
        See
        
        * https://www.notifymyandroid.com/
        * https://pushover.net/ and
        * http://www.prowlapp.com/
        
        for more details about these applications.
        
        Development
        -----------
        
        All development for pushnotify takes place on bitbucket:
        
        * https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-pushnotify/
        
        You can follow this project on Twitter:
        
        * https://twitter.com/pypushnotify
        
        To get started you can do the following::
        
            $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-pushnotify/
            $ cd py-pushnotify
            $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
            $ python setup.py develop
        
        If you discover a bug, please create an issue ticket:
        
        * https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-pushnotify/issues/new
        
        To run the test suite, you will have to create three modules:
        
        * pushnotify/tests/nmakeys.py:
        
            This file must contain two global variables: API_KEYS and
            DEVELOPER_KEY. API_KEYS is a list containing at least one valid API
            key as a string. DEVELOPER_KEY is a string containing a valid
            developer key.
            
        * pushnotify/tests/prowlkeys.py:
        
            This file must contain two global variables: API_KEYS and
            PROVIDER_KEY. API_KEYS is a list containing at least one valid API
            key as a string. PROVIDER_KEY is a string containing a valid
            provider key. REG_TOKEN is a valid registration token that has
            already been validated through the retrieve_token/retrieve_apikey
            process.
        
        * pushnotify/tests/pushoverkeys.py:
        
            This file must contain two global variables: TOKEN and USER.
            TOKEN is a string containing a valid API token. USER is a
            dictionary whose keys are strings containing valid user identifiers.
            The key values are lists containing strings, where each string
            contains a valid device identifier for the given API token. There
            must be one API token, and it must have one device indentifier.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you have already downloaded pushnotify, run the following
        command inside this directory::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        If you have not yet downloaded pushnotify, it would be easier to do
        the following::
        
            $ pip install pushnotify
        
        Either method will install pushnotify into your current environment.
