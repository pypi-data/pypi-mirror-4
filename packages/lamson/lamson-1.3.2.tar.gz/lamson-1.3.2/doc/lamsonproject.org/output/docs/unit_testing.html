                <h1>Unit Testing</h1>
                
Lamson provides the
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.testing-module.html">lamson.testing</a>
to help with writing unit tests.  It doesn&#8217;t do everything for you, but does
enough that you can <span class="caps">TDD</span> your email interactions with pretend users.  It
includes features for checking messages get delivered to queues, checking
spelling, and running things through a fake or real relay.

	<h2>The Log Server</h2>

	<p>The first thing you need to do for testing is to run the &#8220;log server&#8221;:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
$ lamson log
</pre>

	<p>The log server acts as the smart relay host you&#8217;ve configured in your <code>config/settings.py</code>
file by default.  What it does is take all emails that your Lamson application 
&#8220;sends out&#8221; and redeposits them into <code>run/queue</code>.  This queue directory is then also
used by <code>lamson.testing</code> for checking that emails were sent out.  When anything goes
wrong, you can look in this directory and see what is getting sent out.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>An alternative to this setup would be to have all of the sending/routing/relaying done
internal to the whole testing framework, similar to how <code>lamson.testing.RelayConversation</code> works.
However, I found that this made testing that your server actually sends proper emails much
too difficult.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>Test Organization</h2>

	<p>Lamson organizes tests into directories that match the things you&#8217;re testing:</p>

<pre class="code">
librelist $ ls -l tests/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  6 zedshaw  staff   204 Aug 19 17:01 handlers
drwxr-xr-x  8 zedshaw  staff   272 Aug 18 15:50 model
drwxr-xr-x  3 zedshaw  staff   102 Aug 18 15:50 templates
</pre>

	<p>In most of the projects I&#8217;ve only rarely used template tests, but I&#8217;ll cover
them below.  Model tests make sure that any <code>app.model</code> classes work right, and
handler tests make sure that any <code>app.handler</code> classes work.  Nice and simple.</p>

	<p>You can add any other directories you want to this, and you can also use
doctests if you want.  This comes free with
<a href="http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.1/">nosetests</a> and is
very handy.</p>

	<h2>Handler Tests</h2>

	<p>We&#8217;ll use an example from the <a href="http://librelist.com/">librelist.com</a> code base
that validates that a user can subscribe, unsubscribe, and post a message to a
mailing list.  This test was primarily written in a <span class="caps">TDD</span> style, since generally
interactions and usability testing works better
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> style.</p>

	<p>First you have a common preamble of modules that you need to include:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
from nose.tools import *
from lamson.testing import *
from config import settings
import time
from app.model import archive, confirmation

</pre>

	<p>Right away you notice we just include everything from <code>nose.tools</code> and
<code>lamson.testing</code> so that we can use it directly.  Yes, this violates Python
style guidelines, but practicality is more important than dogmatic slavery to
supposed standards.</p>

	<p>After that we include the <code>config.settings</code>, and two modules from <code>app.model</code> that we&#8217;ll
use to check that everything was working.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Notice that we don&#8217;t include anything from <code>app.handlers</code> directly.  These tests are meant
to be from the perspective of a user interacting with the handler via emails.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Once we have that we do a little setup to clear set some common variables and clear
out some queues we&#8217;ll need to check:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
queue_path = archive.store_path('test.list', 'queue')
sender = "sender-%s@sender.com" % time.time()
host = "librelist.com"
list_name = "test.list"
list_addr = "test.list@%s" % host
client = RouterConversation(sender, 'Admin Tests')

def setup():
    clear_queue("run/posts")
    clear_queue("run/spam")
</pre>

	<p>Most of these are just variables used in tests later, but the big one is the
<code>client</code> variable.  It&#8217;s a
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.testing.RouterConversation-class.html">lamson.testing.RouterConversation</a>
class that lets you simulate delivering email to your Lamson project.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p> There&#8217;s also a
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.testing.TestConversation-class.html">lamson.testing.TestConversation</a>
class that actually uses your real <code>config/settings.py</code> to connect to a Relay.
This isn&#8217;t used so much, but is intended for running &#8220;smoke tests&#8221; against a
newly deployed server.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>With that we&#8217;re ready to write out first handler test:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
def test_new_user_subscribes_with_invalid_name():
    client.begin()

    client.say('test-list@%s' % host, "I can't read!", 'noreply')
    client.say('test=list@%s' % host, "I can't read!", 'noreply')
    clear_queue()

    client.say('unbounce@%s' % host, "I have two email addresses!")
    assert not delivered('noreply')
    assert not delivered('unbounce')

    client.say('noreply@%s' % host, "Dumb dumb.")
    assert not delivered('noreply')
</pre>

	<p>This is the longest of the tests, and shows all the various things you can do
with the <code>lamson.testing</code> gear.  Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing in order:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Call <code>client.begin</code> to clear out queues and state and start fresh.</li>
		<li>Use <code>client.say</code> to send an email from that client to your Lamson application.  Notice that you configured the RelayConversation to pretend to be one person with each email getting the same subject line.</li>
		<li>Use <code>lamson.testing.clear_queue</code> when you want to make sure the queue is clean.</li>
		<li>Use <code>lamson.testing.delivered</code> to check if a certain message from someone is in the queue.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>With that you can do pretty much everything you need to send an email and make
sure you get proper replies.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s another example:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
def test_new_user_subscribes():
    client.begin()
    msg = client.say(list_addr, "Hey I was wondering how to fix this?",
                     list_name + '-confirm')
    client.say(msg['Reply-To'], 'Confirmed I am.', 'noreply')
    clear_queue()
</pre>

	<p>Notice in this example we have a fourth parameter <code>list_name + &#39;-confirm&#39;</code> and
we get a <code>msg</code> back from our call to <code>client.say</code>.  This basically combines
<code>client.say</code> with <code>delivered</code> to do it in one shot.  Very commonly, you&#8217;ll want
to say something to your server and make sure you got a certain response, and
then do something with that response.  This is how you do that.</p>

	<p>We then use this '-confirm&#8217; email message to actually subscribe the fake user.</p>

	<p>Finally, here&#8217;s two more examples:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
def test_existing_user_unsubscribes():
    test_new_user_subscribes()
    msg = client.say(list_name + "-unsubscribe@%s" % host,
        "I would like to unsubscribe.", 'confirm')
    client.say(msg['Reply-To'], 'Confirmed yes I want out.', 'noreply')

def test_existing_user_posts_message():
    test_new_user_subscribes()
    msg = client.say(list_addr, "Howdy folks, I was wondering what this is?",
                     list_addr)
    # make sure it gets archived
    assert delivered(list_addr, to_queue=queue(queue_path))
</pre>

	<p>In <code>test_existing_user_unsubscribes</code> what we do is call
<code>test_new_user_subscribes</code> to go through that process again, and then we chain
off that to do an unsubscribe.  There&#8217;s really nothing new here other than that
little trick.</p>

	<p>In <code>test_existing_user_posts_message</code> we do the usual send a message and expect
a reply, but then we <strong>also</strong> make sure that this message was delivered to the
archiver queue.</p>

	<p>Apart from those methods and techniques, there&#8217;s really nothing more to doing a
handler test.  The only additional thing would be using
<a href="http://lamsonproject.org/docs/api/lamson.testing-module.html#assert_in_state">assert_in_state</a>
to make sure that your handler is in a particular state.  I&#8217;d recommend against
doing that too much in a handler test, since it will make your tests brittle.
I only do it when the state is very important, such as when checking that they
are in a <span class="caps">SPAMMING</span> or <span class="caps">BOUNCING</span> state that I need to enforce.</p>

	<h2>Model Tests</h2>

	<p>There&#8217;s less functionality available in <code>lamson.testing</code> for doing your models.  The theory
is that your models will be classes, modules, and <span class="caps">ORM</span> that you need to perform the majority
of your storage and analysis.  Since has very little to do with email you probably won&#8217;t
use <code>lamson.testing</code> as much.</p>

	<p>About the only things you might use are APIs for checking that queues get certain messages
in them, and that certain users are in certain states.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s a quick example from <a href="http://librelist.com">librelist.com</a> again that tests how 
archives work:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
from nose.tools import *
from lamson.testing import *
from lamson.mail import MailRequest, MailResponse
from app.model import archive, mailinglist
import simplejson as json
import shutil

queue_path = archive.store_path('test.list', 'queue')
json_path = archive.store_path('test.list', 'json')

def setup():
    clear_queue(queue_path)
    shutil.rmtree(json_path)

def teardown():
    clear_queue(queue_path)
    shutil.rmtree(json_path)

def test_archive_enqueue():
    msg = MailResponse(From="zedshaw@zedshaw.com", To="test.list@librelist.com",
                       Subject="test message", Body="This is a test.")

    archive.enqueue('test.list', msg)
    assert delivered('zedshaw', to_queue=queue(queue_path))
</pre>

	<p>This is the usual initial setup, and then some extras to make sure that the <a href="http://librelist.com/browser/"><span class="caps">JSON</span> archives</a> is working.  You&#8217;ll notice that we hand construct various messages, call methods on the <code>app.model.archive</code> module, and then use <code>delivered</code> to make sure they&#8217;re correctly delivered.</p>

	<h2>Template Tests</h2>

	<p>Typically you really can only test that your templates are spelled right, or that your templates
render when given certain locals.  I&#8217;ve found that automated testing of templates isn&#8217;t incredibly
useful yet, so the only one I&#8217;ve written is from the <a href="http://oneshotblog.com/">oneshotblog</a> example:</p>

<pre class="code prettyprint">
from nose.tools import *
from lamson.testing import *
from lamson import view
import os
from glob import glob

def test_spelling():
    message = {}
    original = {}
    for path in glob("app/templates/mail/*.msg"):
        template = "mail/" + os.path.basename(path)
        result = view.render(locals(), template)
        spelling(template, result)
</pre>

	<p>This uses <code>lamson.testing.spelling</code> to make sure that each template renders and
that it is spelled correctly.  This uses
<a href="http://www.rfk.id.au/software/pyenchant/">PyEnchant</a> to do the checking, which
turns out to be rather annoying.  If you are interested in improving the
template testing setup, then feel free to talk about your ideas on <a href="mailto:lamson@librelist.com">the lamson
mailing list</a> (but bring code, talk is cheap).</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to develop your application using good testing techniques with
the <code>lamson.testing</code> <span class="caps">API</span>.  If you find additional testing patterns that could be included
then <a href="mailto:lamson@librelist.com">talk about them on the lamson mailing list</a> to see
if they&#8217;re general enough for others.</p>
