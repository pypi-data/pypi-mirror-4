        MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.
        
        MapProxy is actively developed and supported by `Omniscale <http://omniscale.com>`_, it is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Features:
        
        - support clipping of requests to polygon geometries in security API
        - support for WMS 1.3.0 extended layer capabilities

        Improvements:
        
        - WMS source requests and requests to cached tiles are now clipped
          to the extent. this should prevent projection errors when requesting
          large bbox (e.g. over 180/90 in EPSG:4326)
        - improved lock timeouts in mapproxy-seed
        - the debug source does not overwrite the layer extent anymore.
          makes it more usable in demo/wms clients

          option to prevent distortions at the dateline

        - fixed blank image results for servers that call .close() on the
          response (like gunicorn)
        
        Other:
        
        - origin option for tile sources is deprecated. use a custom grid with
          the appropriate origin.
