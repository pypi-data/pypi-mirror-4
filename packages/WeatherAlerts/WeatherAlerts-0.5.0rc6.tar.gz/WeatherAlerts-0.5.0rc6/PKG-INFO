        PROJECT STATUS
        ===================
        This module is a mess, a functional mess, but still a mess.... As I have time, I'm rewriting it and the 0.5.x
        branch is much improved.
        
        
        I've been working on a REST JSON webservice powered by this package, its a working prototype at the moment
        but if you interested, let me know.
        
        
        CURRENT BUILD STATUS:
        
        As of 0.5.x this package has 100% test coverage, every commit is built and tested in both python 2 and python 3.
