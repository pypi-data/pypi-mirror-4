CalendarX builds from several programs and products with GPL licenses.  It is
designed to run on the Plone CMS (also GPL), which in turn builds on the Content
Management Framework (CMF) and the ZOPE Application Server, which are both
released under the ZPL.  Portions of CalendarX that are more or less completely
original are copyright 2004 by Lupa Zurven, and are largely marked as such in
the source code comments.
