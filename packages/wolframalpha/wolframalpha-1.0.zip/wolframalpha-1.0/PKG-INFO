Description: wolframalpha
        ============
        
        Python Client built against the `Wolfram|Alpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_
        v2.0 API.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Basic usage is pretty simple. Create the client with your App ID (request from
        Wolfram Alpha)::
        
            import wolframalpha
            client = wolframalpha.Client(app_id)
        
        Then, you can send queries, which return Result objects::
        
            res = client.query('temperature in Washington, DC on October 3, 2012')
        
        Result objects have `pods` attribute (a Pod is an answer from Wolfram Alpha).
        You may also query for simple the pods which have 'Result' titles::
        
            print(res.results[0].text)
