AudioLazy
=========

Expressive Digital Signal Processing (DSP) package for Python.

Lazyness
--------

There are several tools and packages that let the Python use and
expressiveness look like languages such as MatLab and Octave. However, the
eager evaluation done by most of these tools make it difficult, perhaps
impossible, to use them for real time audio processing. Another difficulty
concerns expressive code creation for audio processing in blocks through
indexes and vectors.

Goal
----

Prioritizing code expressiveness, clarity and simplicity, without precluding
the lazy evaluation, and aiming to be used together with Numpy, Scipy and
Matplotlib as well as default Python structures like lists and generators,
AudioLazy is a starting project written in pure Python proposing digital
audio signal processing (DSP), featuring a simple synthesizer, analysis
tools, filters, biological auditory periphery modeling, among other
functionalities.
