Description: ===============================
        PayPal package for django-oscar
        ===============================
        
        .. image:: https://secure.travis-ci.org/tangentlabs/django-oscar-paypal.png
        
        This package provides integration between django-oscar_ and both `PayPal
        Express`_ and `PayPal Payflow Pro`_.
        
        .. _django-oscar: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar
        .. _`PayPal Express`: https://www.paypal.com/uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_additional-payment-ref-impl1
        .. _`PayPal Payflow Pro`: https://merchant.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=merchant/payment_gateway
        
        These payment options can be used individually or both together.  Further, the
        package is structured so that it can be used without Oscar if you so wish.

          docs for instructions on how to set up the sandbox locally.
