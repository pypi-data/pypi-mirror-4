        Get your private cheeseshop running.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        ::
        
            $ virtualenv pyshop
            $ cd pyshop
            (pyshop)$ source bin/activate
            (pyshop)$ pip install pyshop
            (pyshop)$ cp pyshop.sample.ini pyshop.ini
            (pyshop)$ vim pyshop.ini  # change the pyshop.cookie_key setting
            (pyshop)$ pyshop_install pyshop.ini
            (pyshop)$ pserve pyshop.ini start --log-file=pyshop.log
        
        You shoud edit the pyshop.ini file in order to configure the pyshop.cookie_key,
        the host:port that host the service, ...
        When the pyshop is running visit the web application,
        http://localhost:8000/ by default, to check all is fine.
        
        For production usage, you should create accounts with the "developer" group.
        Visit http://localhost:6543/pyshop/user with the admin account to create
