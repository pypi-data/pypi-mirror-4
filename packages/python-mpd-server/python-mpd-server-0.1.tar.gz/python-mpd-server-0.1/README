python-mpd-server permits to bind a player to a `MPD server <http://mpd.wikia.com>`_. 

You can control your player with a MPD client such as `Sonata
<http://sonata.berlios.de/>`_, `Gmpc <http://gmpc.wikia.com/wiki/>`_ or a command line tool `mpc <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Client:Mpc>`_. This module
defines a server which manages client requests, parses a request and
generates a respond. A MPD command is a class that you can override.

Current supported features are:

- Playback control (play, stop, next, ...)
- Manage a playlist (add, move, delete, ...)
- Store/Load playlists
- User management via password command
