Description: ======================================
        A Foundation Theme for Django Projects
        ======================================
        
        A Pinax theme + based on `Zurb Foundation`_
        Foundation is a popular CSS framework that is light weight, but includes
        all the basics such as; a responsive grid, forms, dialog, navigation tabs,
        buttons, typography and so on.
        You can read more about the ideas behind
        Foundation  and how to use  it for rapid prototyping in this `article`_.

        What's New
        ------------
        
        - Supports the  `--template` for ``django-admin.py startproject``
        - Removed explicit ``Pinax`` dependency. Although it will still work with other
          pinax style apps such as django-user-account
        
        
        Quickstart
        -----------
        To Use ::
            mkvirtualenv mysite
            pip install Django==1.4.1
            django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/pinax/pinax-project-account/zipball/master mysite
            cd mysite
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            python manage.py syncdb && python manage.py runserver
        
        
        Templates
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        
        You should provide your own "footer" template _footer.html
        
        Also change the Site name by editing *fixture/initial_data.json*  you can also use the Admin app for this purpose.
        The **url** name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
        
        
        Upgrading Previous Version
        ---------------------------
        To upgrade you site start by upgrading to the latest version on pinax-theme-foundation ::
        
            pip install -- upgrade pinax-theme-foundation
        
        The big change between Foundation 2 to 3 is the grid. In Foundation 3 you no longer have to use *.container*
        to define the grid. In Foundation 2 the grid was built around
        *.container > .row > .columns* in Foundation 3 you now just have to use *.row > .columns*.
        In Foundation 3 padding and borders no longer increase the width of an element,
        they only go inward so for example in Foundation 3 .three.columns always has a width of 25%
        with a 15px padding on the left and right.
        You can find the Foundation 3 migration guide `here <http://foundation.zurb.com/migration.php>`_
        Remove all **max-width** from css sytling
        
        
        
        
        .. end-here
