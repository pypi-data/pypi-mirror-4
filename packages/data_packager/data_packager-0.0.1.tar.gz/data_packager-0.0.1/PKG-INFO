Description: # Data Packager (data_packager) #
        
        Provides simple tools to allow for the versioned packaging of arbitrary
        assets.
        
        For instance, suppose you have a given data set that your apps depend upon,
        which change slowly, but have considerable impact on your appllication
        behaviors.
        
        You want to manage the data set on a versioned basis, such that somebody
        can install a specific version of the data into their virtualenv.
        
        This gives a simple way for organizing such packages and a simple interface
        for accessing assets within them.
