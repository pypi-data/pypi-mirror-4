Recommendations
===============

By default Pipeline uses YUI Compressor to compress CSS and JS.
YUI Compressor is an excellent stand-alone application for dealing with JS and CSS-files.
YUI Compressor can be downloaded from: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/.

If you do not install YUI Compressor, make sure to disable the compressor in your settings.
