        ==============
         Introduction
        ==============
        
        DistChecker helps with testing project sdist's.  Once installed
        the ``distchecker`` command will be available.  So far all commands
        are expected to be run against a directory which is a project
        egg directory.
        
        Initial setup can be generated by running::
        
          distchecker --setup-config
        
        Example usage is as follows::
        
          # check to make sure the generated sdist is the same as the source
          # files contained in the development directory
          distchecker compare_sdist SomeEggDir
        
          # install the given egg into a fresh virtualenv and print out
          # information such as test coverage and the exact snapshot
          # of dependent eggs that was used
          distchecker test_sdist SomeEggDir
        
          # in this case SomeEggDir is expected to be an egg
          # providing a paster template ... running the command
          # will install the egg into a fresh virtualenv and then
          # create a new egg based on the given paster template and
          # run its tests
          distchecker test_paster_template SomeEggDir somepastertemplate
        
        Please be aware that the temporary virtualenv directories created
        are not currently removed due to debugging purposes.
