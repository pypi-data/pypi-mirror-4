This basically does the same thing as
`python-casjobs <https://github.com/cosmonaut/python-casjobs>`_ but it only
depends on `Requests <http://python-requests.org>`_ which makes it more useful
in my opinion.

Usage
-----

Install it:

::

    pip install casjobs

Here's how you might get the fields in Stripe 82 that hit the Pisces
overdensity:

::

    import casjobs

    query = """SELECT *
    INTO mydb.pisces2
    FROM Stripe82..Field AS p
    WHERE p.mjd_g > 0 AND p.ramin < 355 AND p.ramax > 355
    """

    jobs = CasJobs()
    job_id = jobs.submit(query)
    status = jobs.monitor(job_id)
    print status
