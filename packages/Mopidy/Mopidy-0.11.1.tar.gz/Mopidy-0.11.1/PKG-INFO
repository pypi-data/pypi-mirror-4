        Mopidy is a music server which can play music both from your local hard drive
        and from Spotify. Searches returns results from both your local hard drive and
        from Spotify, and you can mix tracks from both sources in your play queue. Your
        Spotify playlists are also available for use, though we don't support modifying
        them yet.
        
        To control your music server, you can use the Ubuntu Sound Menu on the machine
        running Mopidy, any device on the same network which can control UPnP
        MediaRenderers, or any MPD client. MPD clients are available for most
        platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android and iOS.
