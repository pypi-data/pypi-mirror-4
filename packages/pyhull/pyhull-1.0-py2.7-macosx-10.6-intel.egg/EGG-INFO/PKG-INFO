Description: 
        pyhull is a Python wrapper to Qhull (http://www.qhull.org/) for the
        computation of the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram.
        It is written as a Python C extension, with both high-level and low-level
        interfaces to qhull.
        
        Currently, there is no effective port of the qhull algorithm,
        especially for higher dimensions. While isolated packages exist
        for up to 3D convex hulls, no effective package exist for higher dimensions.
        The only other known code which supports convex hulls in higher dimension is
        the scipy.spatial package, but that code is extremely inefficient compared to
        the original Qhull in C. Pyhull is much faster than the scipy.spatial package.
