******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network
connection from your premises to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS
Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and
your data center, office, or colocation environment, which in many
cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput,
and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based
connections.
