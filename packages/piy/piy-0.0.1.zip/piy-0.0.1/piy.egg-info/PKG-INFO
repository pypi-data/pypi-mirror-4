Description: # piy
        
        
        "POM in YAML" is a simple tool to write [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) POM files using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/).
        
        ## Installation
        
        From the code:
        
            python setup.py install
        
        From PyPI:
        
            easy_install piy
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once you have written your POM pom.yaml file, just execute:
        
            piy
        
        This will show the generated pom.xml in the standard output. When you'd be happy with the result, you can save it by running:
        
            piy > pom.xml
        
        As a geneal rule, I strongly recomment that generated files must not be managed by the source control systems (git, hg, svn or whatever). And this case is not an exception; so, please, don't commit the pom.xml file to your project if you want to avoid synchronization issues with other users/developers.
        
        ## How does it work
        
        The tools pre-processes the pom.yaml file at the current directory, and generates a proper pom.xml. Then you can use Maven as usual.
        
        Althougt with the same goal, the approach is completelly different to [Maven3 polyglot](http://polyglot.sonatype.org/), which adds to Maven3 the ability to work with pom files written in non-XML notations. 
        
        ## Status
        
        **The tools is still in alpha!**
        
        Currently it has a strong issue for its usage:
        
         * It is not completelly functionall without applying [this patch](http://www.yaml.org/) to one of its dependencies
        
        ## Syntax
        
        Basically it's a translation of the current XML tree to YAML.
        
            project:
        
                modelVersion: 4.0.0
                groupId: com.foo
                artifactId: bar
                version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
                packaging: jar
        
                build:
                    plugins:
                        plugin:
                            groupId: org.apache.maven.plugins
                            artifactId: maven-compiler-plugin
                            version: 2.5.1                
                            configuration:
                                source: 1.6
                                target: 1.6
        
                dependencies:
                    dependency:
                        groupId: com.bar
                        artifactId: foo
                        version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
        
        This will be transformed to a normal pom.xml file.
        
        Although not very common in POMs, sometimes attributes are necessary. Since YAML doesn't support attributes, attributes need to start with underline. See for instance the following example to configure the port with the Jetty plugin:
        
            project:
                build:
                    plugins:
                        plugin:
                            groupId: org.mortbay.jetty
                            artifactId: maven-jetty-plugin
                            version: 6.1.10
                            configuration:
                                connectors:
                                    connector:
                                        _implementation: org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector
                                        port: 8080
