        This program is a wrapper around rsync. It will help you:
        
            * if you need to sync files from remote server frequently
            * No need to keep the location of the file in your mind. It finds
              them for you.
        
        Requirements
        ==============
        
            * Python >= 2.6 (Python >= 2.7 for tests)
            * rsync installed
            * locate installed with up-to-date database on the remote system
        
        SSH Configuration
        -----------------
        
        Make sure you have an SSH configuration file in your ``$HOME``
        directory. This tends to be very useful, as it keeps all necessary
        logins and ssh server access configurations, e.g.::
        
            Host spameggs
            Hostname  12.112.11.122
            Compression yes
            CompressionLevel 9
            User guido
        
            Host example2
            HostName example2.examples.com
            User johndoe
            Port 22
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        ..  note::
            Reusing server definitions from SSH Configuration.
        
        Syncing ZODB from remote server configured in ``~/.ssh/config`` as
        spameggs. We choose not the first database, but the second::
        
            $ pwd
            /home/roman/projects/plone4/var/filestorage
            $ zyklop spameggs:Data.fs .
            Use /opt/otherbuildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) n
            Use /opt/buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) y
            rsync -av -e ssh -l roman -p 522 --partial --progress --compress-level=9 12.112.11.122:/opt/buildout/var/filestorage/Data.fs /home/roman/projects/plone4/var/filestorage
        
        Syncing a directory which ends with blobstorage, and not directories
        like blobstorage.old from a remote server::
        
            $ pwd
            /home/roman/projects/plone4/var/blobstorage
            $ zyklop spameggs:blobstorage$ .
            Use /opt/buildout/var/blobstorage? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) y
            rsync -av -e ssh -l roman -p 522 --partial --progress --compress-level=9 12.112.11.122:/opt/buildout/var/blobstorage /home/roman/projects/plone4/var/
        
        Use an **absolute path** if you know exactly where to copy from::
        
            $ zyklop spameggs:/tmp/Data.fs .
            Use /tmp/blobstorage? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) y
            rsync -av -e ssh -l roman -p 522 --partial --progress --compress-level=9 12.112.11.122:/tmp/Data.fs /home/roman/projects/plone4/var/
        
        Syncing a directory which needs higher privileges. We use the ``-s``
        argument::
        
            $ zyklop -s spameggs:blobstorage$ .
            Use /opt/buildout/var/blobstorage? Y(es)/N(o)/A(bort) y
            rsync -av -e ssh -l roman -p 522 --rsync-path=sudo rsync --partial --progress --compress-level=9 12.112.11.122:/opt/buildout/var/blobstorage /home/roman/projects/plone4/var/
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        
        I'm dealing with Zope servers most of my time. Some of them have a
        *huge* Data.fs - an object oriented database. I do have in 99% of the
        cases an older version of the clients database on my PC. Copying the
        whole database will take me ages. Using rsync and simply downloading a
        binary patch makes updating my local database a quick thing.
        
        To summarize, with zyklop I'd like to address two things:
        
            1. Downloading large ZODBs takes a long time and
               bandwidth. I simply don't want to wait that long and download that
               much.
            2. Most of the time I can not remember the exact path where the item
               to copy is on the remote server.
        
        TODO
        ====
        
            * tty support: sometimes needed if SSH is configured to only allow
              tty's to connect.
            * Don't hang if only password auth is configured for SSH

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        0.3 (2013-01-14)
        ----------------
        
            * Changed host, match parameters: Now you can specify the source
              host and path match in one parameter delimited by a column,
              similar to scp (e.g. foohost:/path)
            * Allow to provide an absolute path to the file you'd like to copy.
        
        0.2 (2012-03-08)
        ----------------
        
            * Added basic support for using sudo in finding and syncing (rsync)
            * Added argparse as dependency as Python 2.6 won't have it
            * New positional argument to provide destination to copy
              file/directory
