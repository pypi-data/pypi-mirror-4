Description: Assembler for the 68112D microprocessor
        =======================================
        
        The 68112D is a clone of the 68HC11 microcontroller, with extra instructions
        to generate 2D graphics on a VGA display.
        
        The **asm2d** assembler turns the assembly code into an MIF file (Memory
        Initialization File) that can be used to initialize a memory block during
        compilation and/or simulation.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install asm2d
        
        For development
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python setup.py develop
        
        Running
        -------
        
        Compile a file:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            asm2d source.s
        
        The default output file will have the same name as the source file, but with
        a ``.mif`` extension. You can change this with the ``-o`` flag:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            asm2d source.s -o memory.mif
        
        The size of the memory block will be exactly the number of words needed to
        translate the assembly code. You can change this with the ``-w`` argument:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            asm2d source.s -w 512
