        Py-ProjectMill
        ==============
        
        Python port of https://github.com/mapbox/projectmill
        
        Currently only support ``--mill`` and ``--render``.
        
        The only Python requirement so far are ``testy`` and ``nose`` (for running tests).
        To run tests, first ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` and then just run ``nosetests``.
        
        The remainder of the documentation is adapted from the original project.
        
        ----
        
        Need to generate a bunch of TileMill projects that are nearly identical and
        then render them all out? What to script that? We gotcha covered.
        
        Usage: ``projectmill <command> [options]``
        
        Example: ``projectmill --mill -c config.example.json -t ../tilemill/``
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install with ``pip install -e .`` or ``python setup.py install``.
        If you're using Python 2.7, there are no dependencies unless you want to run the tests.
        If you're using Python 2.6, 3.0, or 3.1, you will need to ``pip install -r requirements-X.Y.txt`` (2.6 / 3.0 / 3.1 don't include ``argparse``, which is required).
        
        Not yet tested with 2.5 or 3.x, but it ought to work with both.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Configuration is expected as a json file which contains an array as the root
        object. See ``config.example.json`` for an example. Each element in the array
        should be an object which can have the following keys::
        
            source        REQUIRED The source project, generally the name of folder it
                          lives in.
        
            destination   REQUIRED The destination project name.
        
            mml           A json snippet which will be merged on top of the project's mml
                          file. To clear out an option set it to 'null'
        
            cartoVars     A json object containing key value pairs which can be use to
                          override variables in in carto stylesheets.
        
            MBmeta        MBTiles: A json object containing key value pairs which will be added to
                          a rendered MBtiles export.
        
            Additionally, the following options will be passed to TileMill's export commnd
        
            format        Export format (png|pdf|svg|mbtiles). (Default: undefined)
        
            bbox          Array containing coordinates of bounding box to export. (Default: undefined)
        
            minzoom       MBTiles: minimum zoom level to export. (Default: undefined)
        
            maxzoom       MBTiles: maximum zoom level to export. (Default: undefined)
        
            width         Image: image width in pixels. (Default: 400)
        
            height        Image: image height in pixels. (Default: 400)
        
            bufferSize    Mapnik render buffer size. (Default: 128)
        
        
        Commands
        ========
        
        ProjectMill accepts the following commands. They can be issued either
        individually or together::
        
            --mill      Generates new tilemill projects based on configuration.
        
            --render    Renders projects that are present in configuration and have been milled.
        
            --upload    Uploads projects that are present in configuration and have been rendered.
        
        
        Options
        =======
        
        We also accept the following options::
        
            -t      Path to the TileMill install
        
            -c      specify a configuration file. (Defaults: ./config.json)
        
            -p      Path to TileMill project folder. (Defaults: ~/Documents/Mapbox)
        
            -f      Replace existing projects (together with mill) or existing projects and exports (together with render).
