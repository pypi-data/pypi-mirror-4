tiddlywebplugins.utils provides a suite of tools that make creating and
handling plugins in TiddlyWeb a bit more sensible.

Essentially the utilities raise duplication to a common core without
encumbering the TiddlyWeb core.

It also provides a virtual namespace, tiddlywebplugins, for other
TiddlyWeb plugins.
