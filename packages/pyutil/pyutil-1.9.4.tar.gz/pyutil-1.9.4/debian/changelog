  * um, maybe the work-around is not to tell debian that those files
    exist?

  * setup: ignore missing README.rst file (I don't know why SimpleGeo's
    build system is generating tarballs without README.rst, but it is)

python-pyutil (1.8.1.55) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Zooko Ofsimplegeo ]
  * sync with latest darcs version
  * tests: skip tests of C speedups if they aren't present (couldn't be
    compiled); This makes it require Twisted Trial to run tests.
  * setup: unzip by default, and require Twisted Trial to run "python
    setup.py test"
  * update to pyutil-1.7.7, include pyutil/_version.py so it has a
    version number
  * version 1.7.8
  * trivial: fix typo
  * benchutil: add parameter for time units, default to 1s, add footer
    defining units, fix bug in auto-choice of N, skip on exception in
    bench_json.py
  * try_decoding: a handy script to find out what codecs a given byte
    sequence might possibly be encoded in It includes the option of
    telling it what resulting characters you were actually expecting. If
    you don't give that option then it just shows you the characters
    that would result if you decoded those bytes with each of the codecs
    that Python knows about. It skips codecs which raise an exception
    when they attempt to decode that sequence of bytes.
  * update to upstream 1.8.1
  * setup: (re-?) apply debian/ directory
  * remove never-completed backport of decimal from python 2.7
  * pyflakes cleanups
  * build-depend on python-coverage
  * build-dep on python-twisted-core to get "trial"
  * debian/rules: run tests with "trial" instead of "setup.py test"
  * try to invoke "trial" within coverage...
  * okay that's not working, how about using setuptools-trial instead
  * debian: depend on python-twisted instead of python-twisted-core so
    that it won't attempt to compile twisted
  * debuil-dep simplejson
  * new name of README
