        MailChimp integration for Plone.
        
        MailChimp_ helps you design email newsletters, share
        them on social networks, integrate with services you already use, and track
        your results.
        
        collective.mailchimp has been written from the scratch in order to replace
        raptus.mailchimp_ for newer
        versions of Plone (> 4.0).
        
        .. _MailChimp: http://mailchimp.com
        .. _raptus.mailchimp: http://plone.org/products/raptus.mailchimp
        
        The difference between collective.mailchimp and raptus.mailchimp is:
        
        - postmonkey_ instead of greatape_ as Python wrapper (because greatape is completely untested, does not support the latest MailChimp API version and seems to be not actively developed any longer)
        - z3c.form_ instead of formlib for forms (because formlib is deprecated)
        - plone.app.registry_ instead of portal_properties for storing properties (because portal_properties will be deprecated soon)
        - it is tested by automated software tests (because untested code is broken code)
        
        .. _postmonkey: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/postmonkey
        .. _greatape: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/greatape
        .. _z3c.form: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form
        .. _plone.app.registry: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.registry
        
        collective.mailchimp is tested on Plone 4.x and should work on Plone > 3.3
        (with the appropriate version pins for plone.app.registry and z3c.form).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Just add collective.mailchimp to the eggs section of your buildout.
        
        
        Multiple MailChimp Lists
        ========================
        
        collective.mailchimp supports multiple MailChimp lists. The MailChimp portlet
        allows administators to choose a MailChimp list from a dropdown list for each
        portlet. The MailChimp newsletter view (@@newsletter) allows to provide a
        list_id (see your MailChimp account) as optional URL parameter::
        
          http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@newsletter?list_id=f3247645gs
        
        If no URL parameter is provided the form just chooses the first MailChimp list
        available (which is fine as long as you have just one list anyway).
        
        
        Extend Newsletter Subscription Form
        ===================================
        
        The collective.mailchimp newsletter form (used in the separate view as well
        as in the portlet) can be extended without touching the code of
        collective.mailchimp.
