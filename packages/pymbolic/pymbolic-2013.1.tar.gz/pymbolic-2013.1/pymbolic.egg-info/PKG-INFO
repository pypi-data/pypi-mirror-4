Description: 
              Pymbolic is a small symbolic manipulation library. Two things set it apart
              from other libraries of its kind:
        
              * Users can easily write their own symbolic operations, simply by deriving
                from the builtin visitor classes.
              * Users can easily add their own symbolic entities to do calculations
                with.
        
              Pymbolic currently understands regular arithmetic expressions, derivatives,
              sparse polynomials, fractions, term substitution, expansion. It automatically
              performs constant folding, and it can compile its expressions into Python 
              bytecode for fast(er) execution.
        
              If you are looking for a full-blown Computer Algebra System, look at 
              `sympy <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sympy>`_ or 
              `PyGinac <http://pyginac.sourceforge.net/>`_. If you are looking for a
              basic, small and extensible set of symbolic operations, pymbolic may
              well be for you.
