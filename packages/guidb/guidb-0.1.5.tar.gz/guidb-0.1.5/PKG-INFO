Description: GUIDB
        =====
        
        Guidb is a minimal layer of code on top of Leveldb, using Google's
        protocol buffers and ZeroMQ, to build a key-value distributed
        datastore.
        
        The goal of this project is more academic than practical, to prove
        that key-value datastores can be distributed and scaled-up very easily
        with minimal work.
        
        I honestly doubt that it will grow to a enterprise-class database
        because then it will be as complex as Riak or Cassandra, and I don't
        have the time, the knowledge nor the talent to do that.
        
        If you have comments, use the comment form in my webpage for any
        post. And ignore the fact that it's in Spanish.
        
        There is no public development repository at this time because I think
        that is not necessary for roughy 200 lines of code, but I could set it
        up upon request.
        
        Look at the tests (test.py) for fully working examples. It's as easy
        as it gets.
