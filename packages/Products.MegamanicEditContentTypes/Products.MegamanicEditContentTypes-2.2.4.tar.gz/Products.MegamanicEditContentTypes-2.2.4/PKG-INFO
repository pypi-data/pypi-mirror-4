Description: Various content types that are usable in the MegamanicEdit framework,
        a contact type with endless options for emails, addresses and so on, a
        contact landing page that can generate contacts based on an object
        template, an Email message type for generating and sending out emails.
        
        A lot of what used to be in GrailTact has now been moved to this
        package.
        
        Note on email messages: Home folders need to be enabled, and the email
        message type has been specified to not use any workflow and set itself
        to viewable only by the creator of the message and any user with the
        Manager role.
