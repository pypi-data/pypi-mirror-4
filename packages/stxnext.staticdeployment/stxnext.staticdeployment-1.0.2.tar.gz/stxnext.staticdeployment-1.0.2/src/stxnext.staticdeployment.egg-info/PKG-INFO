        ########################
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        ``stxnext.staticdeployment`` is a tool to deploy Plone site to static files. It supporst Plone 3 and Plone 4 (including sites using Diazo themes).
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Edit buildout.cfg and append ``stxnext.staticdeployment`` to eggs and zcml parameters in instance section::
        
        	[instance]
        	eggs =
        	  ...
        	  stxnext.staticdeployment
        	
        	zcml =
        	  ...
        	  stxnext.staticdeployment
        
        Instance must be rebuild and restarted::
        
        	./bin/buildout
        	./bin/instance stop
        	./bin/instance start
        
        This product must be also installed inside Plone site. Do do it, go to *Site Setup* -> *Add/Remove Products*, select checkbox near *stxnext.staticdeployment* and click *Install* button.
        
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Every website has own configuration (different set of eggs, skin, products etc.) - this I meas as project. But website can have few instances (development, test and production instances). Because of this, configuration is split for two parts: 
        
         * instance parameters:
          
           - parameters connected to instance - e.g.: domain
           - configured in *Control Panel* - can be edited throw the web (*Site Setup* -> *Static deployment* -> *Settings* tab)
           - form has description and validation - can be used by less experienced users
        
         * website parameters:
          
           - stored in INI file
           - created by developer of website
           - can be used by many sites
           - `default configuration`_ (included in egg)
           - default configuration can be overriden by file `${buildout:directory}/etc/staticdeployment.ini`
