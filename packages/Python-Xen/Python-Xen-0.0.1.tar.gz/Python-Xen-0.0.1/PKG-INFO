Description: 
        A library which uses bits of the libxc and libxs Python bindings to provide basic administration
        and introspection of Xen domains.
        
        Tasks covered by this library presently include:
        
        - Getting a list of ``Domain`` objects.
        - Getting status on ``Domain`` objects.
        - Shutting down, Destroying and Restarting ``Domain`` objects.
        - Pausing and unpausing ``Domain`` objects.
        - Getting statistics (like ``xentop``) for ``Domain`` objects.
        
        Creation may be covered later, but it seems unnecessary.
