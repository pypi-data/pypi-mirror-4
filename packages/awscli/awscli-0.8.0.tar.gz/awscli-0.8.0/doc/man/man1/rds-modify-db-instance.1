.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-option\-group\-name\fP  (string)
Indicates that the DB Instance should be associated with the specified option
group. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except in the
following case and the change is applied during the next maintenance window
unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is set to \fBtrue\fP for this
request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM,
this change can cause a brief (sub\-second) period during which new connections
are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-db\-parameter\-group\-name\fP  (string)
The name of the DB Parameter Group to apply to this DB Instance. Changing this
parameter does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the
next maintenance window unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is set to
\fBtrue\fP for this request.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.sp
Constraints: The DB Parameter Group must be in the same DB Parameter Group
family as this DB Instance.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-db\-security\-groups\fP  (list of string)
A list of DB Security Groups to authorize on this DB Instance. Changing this
parameter does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously
applied as soon as possible.
.sp
Constraints:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters
.IP \(bu 2
First character must be a letter
.IP \(bu 2
Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

.ft P
.fi
.TP
.B \fB\-\-multi\-az\fP  (boolean)
Specifies if the DB Instance is a Multi\-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter
does not result in an outage and the change is applied during the next
maintenance window unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is set to
\fBtrue\fP for this request.
.sp
Constraints: Cannot be specified if the DB Instance is a read replica.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-allow\-major\-version\-upgrade\fP  (boolean)
Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter
does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon
as possible.
.sp
Constraints: This parameter must be set to true when specifying a value for
the \-\-engine\-version parameter that is a different major version than the DB
Instance\(aqs current version.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-preferred\-maintenance\-window\fP  (string)
The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur,
which may result in an outage. Changing this parameter does not result in an
outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously
applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot,
and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then
changing this parameter will cause a reboot of the DB Instance. If moving this
window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the
current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.sp
Format: ddd:hh24:mi\-ddd:hh24:mi

Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
.sp
Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes
.TP
.B \fB\-\-vpc\-security\-group\-ids\fP  (list of string)

change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
.sp
Constraints:
.INDENT 7.0

.TP
.B \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP  (boolean)
Specifies whether or not the modifications in this request and any pending
modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of
the \fB\-\-preferred\-maintenance\-window\fP setting for the DB Instance.
.sp
If this parameter is passed as \fBfalse\fP , changes to the DB Instance are
applied on the next call to  reboot\-db\-instance , the next maintenance reboot,
or the next failure reboot, whichever occurs first. See each parameter to
determine when a change is applied.
.sp
Default: \fBfalse\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-\-auto\-minor\-version\-upgrade\fP  (boolean)
Indicates that minor version upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB
Instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter does not
result in an outage except in the following case and the change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will result if this
parameter is set to \fBtrue\fP during the maintenance window, and a newer minor
version is available, and RDS has enabled auto patching for that engine
version.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-preferred\-backup\-window\fP  (string)
The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated
backups are enabled, as determined by the \fB\-\-backup\-retention\-period\fP .
Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
.sp
Constraints:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Must be in the format hh24:mi\-hh24:mi
.IP \(bu 2
Times should be Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)
.IP \(bu 2
Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window
.IP \(bu 2
Must be at least 30 minutes
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-iops\fP  (integer)
The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS
instance. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change
is applied during the next maintenance window unless the
\fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is set to \fBtrue\fP for this request.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.sp
Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current
value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are
rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.
.sp
Type: Integer
.TP
.B \fB\-\-master\-user\-password\fP  (string)
The new password for the DB Instance master user. Can be any printable ASCII
character except "/", "", or "@".
.sp
Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is
asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request
and the completion of the request, the \fB\-\-master\-user\-password\fP element
exists in the \fBPendingModifiedValues\fP element of the operation response.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.sp
Constraints: Must be 8 to 41 alphanumeric characters (MySQL), 8 to 30
alphanumeric characters (Oracle), or 8 to 128 alphanumeric characters (SQL
Server).
.IP Note
Amazon RDS API actions never return the password, so this action provides a
way to regain access to a master instance user if the password is lost.
.RE
.TP
.B \fB\-\-allocated\-storage\fP  (integer)
The new storage capacity of the RDS instance. Changing this parameter does not
result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance
window unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is set to \fBtrue\fP for
this request.
.sp

.sp
\fBOracle\fP
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.sp
Valid Values: 10\-1024
.sp
Constraints: Value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current
value. Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are
rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.
.sp
\fBSQL Server\fP
.sp
Cannot be modified.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-engine\-version\fP  (string)
The version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing this
parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during the next
maintenance window unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is set to
\fBtrue\fP for this request.
.sp
For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB Parameter Group is currently in
use, a new DB Parameter Group in the DB Parameter Group Family for the new
engine version must be specified. The new DB Parameter Group can be the
default for that DB Parameter Group Family.
.sp
Example: \fB5.1.42\fP
.TP
.B \fB\-\-db\-instance\-class\fP  (string)
The new compute and memory capacity of the DB Instance. To determine the
instance classes that are available for a particular DB engine, use the
describe\-orderable\-db\-instance\-options action.
.sp
Passing a value for this parameter causes an outage during the change and is
applied during the next maintenance window, unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP
parameter is specified as \fBtrue\fP for this request.
.sp
Default: Uses existing setting
.sp
Valid Values: \fBdb.t1.micro | db.m1.small | db.m1.medium | db.m1.large |

The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parameter to a
positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter to 0 disables
automated backups.

non\-zero value or from a non\-zero value to 0. These changes are applied during
the next maintenance window unless the \fB\-\-apply\-immediately\fP parameter is
set to \fBtrue\fP for this request. If you change the parameter from one
non\-zero value to another non\-zero value, the change is asynchronously applied
as soon as possible.
