Stupidly-simple python mocking utility with moxie.

Mocksey Motivation
==================

I was teaching a class on unit testing to a group of co-workers who were familiar with `Simple Test for PHP <http://www.simpletest.org/>`_ so I hacked together what is becoming Mocksey.

Mocksey the TDD'd version of that TDD utilty. `It's so meta even this acronym <http://xkcd.com/917/>`_.

Installation
============

Either find mocksey on PyPI_ or install it with pip or easy_install
::

  pip install mocksey
  #or
  easy_install mocksey

Basic Usage
===========

It's pretty simple.  Create a mocked object with generate_mock, inject it (or monkey patch) and set up your assertions.  After your function call(s), simply call 'run_asserts' and win!

The unit tests are a pretty decent working example.
