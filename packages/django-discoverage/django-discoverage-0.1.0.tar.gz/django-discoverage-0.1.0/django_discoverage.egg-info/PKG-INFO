Description: django-discoverage
        ==================
        
        Adds `coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/>`_ to Jannis Leidel and
        Carl Meyer's `django-discover-runner
        <https://github.com/jezdez/django-discover-runner>`_.
        
        Inspired by `django-coverage <https://bitbucket.org/kmike/django-coverage/>`_.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        One of the objectives of ``django-discover-runner`` is to allow separating a
        Django app's tests from the code it's testing. Since tests no longer reside in
        an app, ``django-discoverage`` needs a different way to know which apps to
        include in the coverage report. It currently collects apps (packages) by looking
        for an attribute (by default ``TESTS_APPS``) on each ``TestCase`` instance in
        the suite.
        
        For example::
        
            class MyTestCase(TestCase):
                TESTS_APPS = ('mycoolapp', 'myproject.anothercoolapp')
                ...
        
        All modules in the listed apps (except those specified in ``OMIT_MODULES``) will
        appear in the standard ``coverage`` report.
        
        Settings
        --------
        
        ``APPS_TEST_CASE_ATTR``
          The attribute ``django-discoverage`` looks for on each ``TestCase`` instance.
        
        ``OMIT_MODULES``
          Modules not to be traced by ``coverage``. See the `coverage API
          documentation
          <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/api.html#coverage.coverage>`_ for more
          details.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        * Investigate discovering the apps being tested from the test modules imports
          (this could be really annoying)
        * Check whether the report can be customized to display package names instead of
          paths
