============
mekk.greader
============

Simple Google Reader access API. The module implements a couple of
feed management functions, making it possible to manage Google Reader
subscriptions (subscribe, unsubscribe, rename, (re)tag feeds) from
Python scripts and programs.

Warning
=======

No official documentation was used, I partially reverse-engineered
the API and partially used unofficial descriptions found on the web.
So there are absolutely no guarantees!

Still, I regularly use this module to subscribe, unsubscribe and
rename feeds, especially via greader2org_.
