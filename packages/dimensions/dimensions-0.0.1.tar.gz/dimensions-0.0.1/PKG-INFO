Description: dimensions
        ==========
        
        A pure Python library for reading the width and height of images.
        
        usage
        -----
        
        For a single image:
        
            > dimensions src/sample.png
            src/sample.png (405, 239)
        
        Wildcards also work (the escape '\' is only for PyPi RST...):
        
            > dimensions src/\*.png
            src/sample.png (405, 239)
            src/sample2.png (473, 469)
        
        As always, full details are available via `dimensions -h`.
