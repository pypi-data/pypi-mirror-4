Description: django-registration-withemail
        =====================
        
        This is a simple user-registration application for Django,
        designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
        requires a functional installation of Django 1.5 or newer, but has no
        required dependencies.
        django-registration-withemail is hugely inspired by the popular django-registration which 
        is not yet compatible with django 1.5.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        To install django-registration-withemail, run on terminal: ::
        
            $ [sudo] pip install registration_withemail
        
        	Add "registration_withemail" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = (
        	  ...
        	  'registration_withemail',
        	)    
        
            Add AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'registration_withemail.EldonUser' to your settings.
        	
        	Run `python manage.py syncdb` to create the User model.
        
        
        
        Required settings
        =================
        
        ``ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_DAYS``
            This is the number of days users will have to activate their
            accounts after registering. If a user does not activate within
            that period, the account will remain permanently inactive.
        
        ``ADD_TOS``
        	Adds a term of service checkbox to the registration form
        
        ``ADD_RECAPTCHA``
        	Adds recaptcha to the registration form. You must install django-recaptcha
        	in order to use this setting. For further information about recaptcha
        	see https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha
        
        Setting up URLs
        =================
        
        Include the registration_withemail URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
        (r'^accounts/', include('registration_withemail.urls')),
        
        Users would then be able to register by visiting the URL
        ``/accounts/register/``, 
        
        and login (once activated) at
        
        ``/accounts/login/``, etc.
        
        
        Required templates
        =================
        
        In the default setup, you will need to create several templates
        required by django-registration-withemail, and possibly additional templates
        required by views in ``django.contrib.auth``.
