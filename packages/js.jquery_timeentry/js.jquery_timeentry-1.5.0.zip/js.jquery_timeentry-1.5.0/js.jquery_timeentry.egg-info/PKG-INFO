        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `jQuery Time Entry`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jQuery Time Entry`: http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.jquery_timeentry``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``time_entry`` from ``js.jquery_timeentry`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_timeentry import time_entry
          >>> time_entry.need()
        
        The localizations of the Time Entry package are also available::
        
          >>> from js.jquery_timeentry import time_entry_de
          >>> time_entry_de.need()
