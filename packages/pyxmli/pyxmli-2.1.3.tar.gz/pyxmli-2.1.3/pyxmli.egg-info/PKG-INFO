Description: PyXMLi helps Python developers generate invoices in [XMLi 2.0](http://www.xmli.org), the open-source invoice format designed by [Greendizer](http://greendizer.com).
        
        ##Why another format?
        Simply because none of the available formats was good enough for what its creators needed it for.
        
        ##Design goals
        -    Human-readable, *Web-friendly* format; 
        -    Carry data structures, not business logic;
        -    Stand-alone, with every detail possible from creation to archiving;
        -    Privilege existing standards whenever possible.
        
        ##Features
        PyXMLi comes with a great deal of features to make it really easier for Python developers to:
        
        -    Generate XMLi 2.0 invoices in their favorite language;
        -    Strongly validate pretty much every field locally before sending their invoices; 
        -    Sign their invoices using the XMLDsig standard and a simple RSA key.
        
        ##Requirements
        
        -    Python 2.5+
        -    lxml 2.3+
        -    PyCrypto 2.6+
        
        (Built-in setup will install all the dependencies automatically).
        
        ##Compatibility
        PyXMLi is compatible with Google App Engine and their Python 2.7 runtime.
        
        ##Setup
        Using *pip*:
        
            sudo pip install git+https://github.com/Greendizer/PyXMLi.git
        
        Using *easy_install*:
        
            sudo easy_install pyxmli
