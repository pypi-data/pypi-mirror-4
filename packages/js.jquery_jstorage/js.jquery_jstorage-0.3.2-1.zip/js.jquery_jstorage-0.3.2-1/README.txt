js.jquery_jstorage
******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jStorage`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jStorage`: http://www.jstorage.info

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_jstorage``) are published to some URL.
