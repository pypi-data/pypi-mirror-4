Welcome to pkgme, a tool that will help you package your application for Debian/Ubuntu.

pkgme takes care of creating the files needed for packaging, by inspecting your
code. As long as your project follows the conventions of one of the languages/project
types that pkgme supports pkgme will be able to generate working packaging without
you having to deal with any of the details.
