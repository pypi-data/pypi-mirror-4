Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This products creates a portlet to show weather information 
        as provided by AEMET_ .
        
        It parses an XML file and creates a data structure to create
        a portlet based on a structure similar to the one provided by
        the product Meteo_ . This product worked great, but due to
        the constantly changing HTML of the AEMET_ site, it failed easily.
        
        Now AEMET provides a fixed XML for each place, so you just have
        to create a portlet and type the URL of the XML file you want
        to show. The parsing results are cached in memory using 
        `plone.memoize`_'s RAMCache.
        
        If you want to customize the look and feel of the portlet, use
        `z3c.jbot`_ and look at the internals of the dict created after
        parsing the XML at aemetparser.py file.
        
        You can see examples of customization of this portlet at:
