        Introduction
        ============
        
        This package adds a widget to z3cform widgets so you can have a textarea field with a TeX Preview div on the edit form.
        
        It also loads the MathJax on the registry so it's not necessary to have collective.mathjax
        
        TODO
        ====
        
        * Pulish the js on the edit form
        * Tests
        * Load needed script.js only on edit of a type that has this kind of widget
