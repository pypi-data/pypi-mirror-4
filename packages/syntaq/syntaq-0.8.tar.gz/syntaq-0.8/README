Syntaq

Syntaq is a lightweight markup language based on (and backward compatible with)
Creole. The package comes with a Python/Jython module which allows compilation
of markup to HTML.

On top of standard Creole notation, Syntaq also supports the following:

* Subscript and superscript
* Inline and block quotations
* Inline and block computer code
* HTML class values on preformatted and code blocks
* Table cell alignment
