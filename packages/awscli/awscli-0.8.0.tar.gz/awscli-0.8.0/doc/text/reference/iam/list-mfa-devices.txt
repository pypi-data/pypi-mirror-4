list-mfa-devices
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Lists the MFA devices. If the request includes the user name, then
this action lists all the MFA devices associated with the specified
user name. If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user
name implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID signing the request.

You can paginate the results using the "--max-items" and "--marker"
parameters.

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--user-name"  (string)
   Name of the user whose MFA devices you want to list.

"--marker"  (string)
   Use this only when paginating results, and only in a subsequent
   request after you've received a response where the results are
   truncated. Set it to the value of the "--marker" element in the
   response you just received.

"--max-items"  (integer)
   Use this only when paginating results to indicate the maximum
   number of MFA devices you want in the response. If there are
   additional MFA devices beyond the maximum you specify, the
   "IsTruncated" response element is "true" .
