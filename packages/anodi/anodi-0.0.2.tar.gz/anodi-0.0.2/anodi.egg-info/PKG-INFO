Description: ==============================================
         `anodi`: The `Agoraplex` Annotations Toolkit
        ==============================================
        
        `anodi` [#etymology]_ is a decorator-based backport of `PEP 3107`__,
        function annotations, to Python 2.7, along with a limited set of tools
        based on those annotations (e.g., `anodi.tools.document`, which hoists
        annotations into the docstring, for the `Sphinx`__ `autodoc`__
        extension to find).

        .. [#etymology]
           **Etymology:** The Welsh for `annotation` is `anodi` (according to
           `Google Translate`__). It won out over translations to other
           languages because it's short, and phonetically (and, thus,
           mnemonically), related. It's also a tribute to my friend, `Allen
           Briggs`__, who passed away, unexpectedly, in March of 2012. Allen
           was an amateur student of Welsh, when he wasn't busy `maintaining
           the mac68k port of NetBSD`__, or, as a consequence of his \*BSD
           work, being `credited in iOS`__.
