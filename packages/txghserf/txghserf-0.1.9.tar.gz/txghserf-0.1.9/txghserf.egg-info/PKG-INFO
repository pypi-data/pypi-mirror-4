Description: Twisted GitHub Service Hooks
        ============================
        
        This is just a boilerplate for implementing a GitHub Service Hooks server
        based on Twisted. 
        
        Uses klein and twisted.
        
        Impement your on "run.py" and start it like::
        
            twistd -n web --class=run.resource
        
        It will parse incomming hooks and covert the JSON into objects.
        
        It is planed to also include a simple web tool to register hooks or check
        hook status.
