OE Bakery - OpenEmbedded development environment tool
--------------------------------------------------------------

OE Bakery is a tool for managing OpenEmbedded development environments.
It provides a terse file format for describing a specific
OpenEmbedded development environment setup, and a simple command-line
tool for setting up development environments, updating development
environments according to changes to the setup, and using it
to develop and build software.

The goal is to offer a tool which help OpenEmbedded developers
* easily share OpenEmbedded development environment setups with other
  developers, and
* make it easier to work with multiple OpenEmbedded development
  environments.

Example:

Developer needs to work with OpenEmbedded for project 'foobar'.

$ oe clone git://dev.doredevelopment.dk/foobar/bakery.git bakery

	This clones the bakery.git repository, which contains the
	development environment setup, clones all additional required
	repositories and places them at the desired locations in
	the development environment, adds any additional git remote
	repository references, and checks out specific versions
	or branches for the repositories if required.

$ cd bakery
$ oe bake bootstrap-image meta-toolchain

	This sets up the required shell environment variables
	needed for BitBake, and calls bitbake with the remaining
	arguments.
	The TMPDIR variable is set properly, with all symlinks
	dereferenced.

$ oe update --pull

	This pulls the remote repositories for updates to the
	development environment, and the upstream tracked branches.
	This could fx. cause a specific version of BitBake to
	be checked out, additional repositories checked out,
	and remote references added and changed.


The configuration required for this is an INI file, which could
look something like the following:

[remotes]
origin = git://dev.doredevelopment.dk/bakery.git

[submodules]
bitbake = git://git.openembedded.net/bitbake.git tags/1.8.18
openembedded = git://foo.bar/openembedded.git stable/2009

[remotes "openembedded"]
oe = git://git.openembedded.net/openembedded.git
