Experimental. Not maintained and not used within Lino.

This package contains mainly a copy of `odfpy.contrib.html2odt` 
(https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/odfpy). 
One modification by LS in the original files:

- :file:`html2odt.py` : changed import statement for `emptycontent`

The content of this file (:file:`__init__.py`) is my own derived work.

I wanted to use the HTML2ODTParser not for grabbing 
a complete HTML page and creating a full .odt file, 
but for converting a chunk of HTML into a chunk of ODF XML.

Example:

>>> html = '''This is<br>a <em>simple</em> <b>test</b>.'''
>>> print html2odt(html)
This is<text:line-break/>a <em>simple</em> test.

Note that the Parser ignores the ``<b>...</b>`` tag.
Seems that this simply isn't yet implemented.
