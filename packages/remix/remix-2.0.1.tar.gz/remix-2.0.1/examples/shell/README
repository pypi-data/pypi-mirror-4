remix.py
========

A stupid shell for the Echo Nest Remix API.

I had SuperCollider one-liner envy, so I created this.


Commands:
  load: loads the filename
  play: play the result of the last command, if it can be played (currently Mac only)
  save: save the result of the last command, if it can be rendered
  help: be minimally helpful
  anything else: try to interpret it in the current environment

Environment:
  beats, bars, tatums, sections, segments: all from the currently loaded file
  _: the last-defined AudioRenderable
  analysis: container for all the other analysis products in the file
  
  libraries (i.e., the namespace you have to work with):
    from echonest.remix.audio import *
    from echonest.remix.audio import AudioQuantumList as aql
    from echonest.remix.audio import AudioQuantum as aq
    from echonest.remix.selection import *
    from echonest.remix.sorting import *

$ ./remix.py ../music/BillieJean.mp3

> tatums.that(fall_on_the(1))
> play
> save bj.mp3
> load ../music/aha.mp3
> segments.that(have_pitch_max(analysis.key['value']))
> play
> beats.that(overlap_starts_of(_))
> play
> ^D
