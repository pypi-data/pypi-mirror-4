The problem:
============

Making presentations is no fun!
-------------------------------

----

GUI tools are inflexible
========================

It's hard to reorganize or import text

Sluggy and memory hungry

You get caught up in design early in the process.

----

Use reStructuredText!
=====================

You can use your favorite text-editor!

Many tools available: Landslide, S5

Convenient (and powerful!)

----

But then there was Prezi
========================

Sliding from left to right is no longer enough.

You need to be able to...

----

:data-y: r1000

...pan...
=========

----

:data-rotate: 90

...rotate...
============

----

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r500
:data-scale: 0.02

...and zoom!
============

----

:data-x: r-1000

But Prezi is a GUI
==================

So we are back to square one.

(And it is closed source to boot)

----

What about Impress.js?
======================

It's open source!

Supports pan, tilt and zoom!

----

:data-y: r800
:data-rotate-x: 180

In three dimensions!
====================

But....

----


It's HTML
=========

Not an friendly format to edit

----

:data-x: 1000

Manual positioning!
===================

So inserting one slide means 

repositioning all the following slides!

----

Is there no solution?
=====================

Of course there is!

----

:data-rotate-x: 180
:data-scale: 3
:data-x: r1500
:data-y: r1000

Introducing *Hovercraft!*
=========================

----

:data-x: r-3500

reStructuredText
----------------

....

impress.js
----------

plus
....

impressConsole.js
-----------------

positioning!
------------

----

:data-y: r-1000

Position slides
===============

Automatically!

Absolutely!

Relative the the previous slide!

Along an SVG path!

----

Presenter console!
==================

* A view of the current slide
* A view of the next slide
* Your notes
* The time
* and a timer!

----

Hovercraft!
===========

The merge of convenience and cool!

:data-scale: 5
:data-x: 0
:data-y: 1800
