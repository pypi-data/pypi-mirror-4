        Introduction
        ============
        
        ``plomino.patternslib`` is a Plomino_ plugin that provides fields and other form elements built using the 
        `Patternslib`_  javascript library.  In its initial implementation, the *Chosen* select boxes from *HarvestHQ* are 
        made available.
        
        For more information, see the `Related Links`_ below.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Add ``plomino.patternslib`` to the list of ``eggs`` of your ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` section.  Re-run buildout.
        
        Use
        ===
        Activate ``plomino.patternslib`` either in ``portal_quickinstaller``, or from the ``/prefs_install_products_form`` 
        Add-ons control panel on your Plone site.
        
        Assuming you already have Plomino installed on your site, you will now have a new field type **Chosen** available to add
        to your Plomino forms. It can be configured exactly like a *Selection List* field.
        
        Examples
        ========
        To see working examples of the style and behavior of the **Chosen** field, see Harvest_.  Currently, only the 
        *Multiple Select* type is available, but more will be added in upcoming releases.
