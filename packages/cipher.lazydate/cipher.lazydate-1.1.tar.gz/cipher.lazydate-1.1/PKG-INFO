Description: ========
        LazyDate
        ========
        
        This library provides a `zope.schema` field and a value object for a
        user friendly datetime specification.  The date is stored as string,
        and can have various textual formats, such as "1 month ago" or
        "tomorrow", "01/02/03" or "2012-01-01".  The actual datetime is
        calculated by the value object as needed.
