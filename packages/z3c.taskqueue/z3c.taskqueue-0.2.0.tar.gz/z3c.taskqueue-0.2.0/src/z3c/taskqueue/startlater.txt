Remote Task Execution
=====================

Start later special
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usage
_____

Let's now start by creating a single service:

  >>> from z3c import taskqueue
  >>> service = taskqueue.service.TaskService()

Let's now define a task that simply echos an input string:

  >>> def echo(input):
  ...     return input

  >>> echoTask = taskqueue.task.SimpleTask(echo)

Let's now register the task as a utility:

  >>> import zope.component
  >>> zope.component.provideUtility(echoTask, name='echo')

Since the service cannot instantaneously complete a task, incoming jobs are
managed by a queue.
More than that, sometimes we need to have a jobid and the job in place with
all inputs and stuff, but start it later.
Watch for the ``startLater=True``.

  >>> jobid = service.add(u'echo', {'foo': 'bar'}, startLater=True)
  >>> jobid
  1392637175 

The ``add()`` function schedules the task called "echo" to be executed with
the specified arguments. The method returns a job id with which we can inquire
about the job.

  >>> service.getStatus(jobid)
  'start later'

Since the job has not been added to the queue, the status is set to
"start later". Further, there is no result available yet:

  >>> service.getResult(jobid) is None
  True

As long as the job is not being processed, it can be cancelled:

  >>> service.cancel(jobid)
  >>> service.getStatus(jobid)
  'cancelled'

Let's see how the starting later works.
Add a job again:

  >>> jobid = service.add(u'echo', {'foo': 'bar'}, startLater=True)
  >>> jobid
  1392637176 

It's still in the status ``start later``:

  >>> service.getStatus(jobid)
  'start later'

Do here some processing...
Now start the job really:

  >>> service.startJob(jobid)
  True

The status changed to ``queued``:

  >>> service.getStatus(jobid)
  'queued'

Starting the job again won't work:

  >>> service.startJob(jobid)
  False

From this point on the job will behave as it were added with ``add`` without
the ``startLater=True`` parameter.

  >>> service.processNext()
  True

  >>> service.getStatus(jobid)
  'completed'

  >>> service.getResult(jobid)
  {'foo': 'bar'}
  
  >>> service.getError(jobid)
  'None'
