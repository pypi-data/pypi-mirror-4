        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is library for building adminstrative interface on top of Flask framework.
        
        Flask-Admin comes with few batteries out of the box: model scaffolding for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
        `MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_ and `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_ ORMs and
        simple file management interface.
        
        However, you're not limited by provided functionality - instead of providing simple scaffolding for the ORM
        models, Flask-Admin provides tools that can be used to build adminstrative interface of any complexity,
        using consistent look and feel.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Flask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find `documentation here <http://readthedocs.org/docs/flask-admin>`_.
        
        3rd Party Stuff
        ---------------
        
        Flask-Admin is built with help of `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ and `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_.
