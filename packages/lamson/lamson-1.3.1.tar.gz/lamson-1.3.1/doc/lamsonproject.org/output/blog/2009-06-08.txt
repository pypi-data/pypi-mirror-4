Title:  A Screencast And Docs On Deploying Lamson And OneShotBlog

I just finished writing some new documentation on "Deploying Lamson and OneShotBlog":/docs/deploying_lamson.html that
shows you how to install Lamson and all required software into a completely clean Python 2.6 and virtualenv configuration.
The instructions take you from nothing to a running "oneshotblog.com":http://oneshotblog.com/ installation that you can 
play with and hack on.  The process of doing Lamson deployments is still a little too rough for me, but these instructions
should get people started.

I also created the first screencast "teaching you how to do the same deployment":/videos/ but stopping at installing
"oneshotblog.com":http://oneshotblog.com to keep things short.  It is basically me talking and typing into a terminal 
window to 12 minutes showing you how to do it.  You can also "download the video":http://www.archive.org/details/Lamsonproject.orgDeployLamsonInAVirtualenv
from "archive.org":http://archive.org/ to get a better viewing experience.


Being my first screencast I can say that it is very tedious.  I'll be working on various strategies to make the
process more streamlined and easier since having to take a whole day for each one will drive me insane.

If you have suggestions on making the video better, "let me know":/contact.html and also if you know of tools to
help clean up video.  One thing I know right away needs to improve is the sound quality.  An apartment in NYC is just
too damn noisy for this kind of thing.

Enjoy, and don't forget that I'll be "presenting Lamson at the NYLUG Python workshop tomorrow June 9th at 6:00pm":http://nylug.org/pipermail/nylug-announce/2009-June/000795.html
so come on down if you want to get your Lamson working.
