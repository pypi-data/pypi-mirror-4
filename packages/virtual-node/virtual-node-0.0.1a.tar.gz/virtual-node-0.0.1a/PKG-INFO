Description: virtual-node
        ============
        
        This package is a wrapper around the `nose.js`_ sources and provides a
        convenient way to install it directly into your ``virtualenv`` instead
        of globally. I created this package to play around with a simple 
        installation for Django projects that us `django-compressor`_'s
        precompiler to generate CSS from `less`_ files.
        
        The install routine used in ``setup.py`` is adapted from the
        `nodeenv`_ package provided by Eugene Kalinin. The difference is that I want
        to install node.js into an existing ``virtualenv`` instead of creating
        a specific environment for node.
        
        I am using this in combination with `virtual-less`_ which installs the
        ``lessc`` commandline tool into a virtual environment.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installing the ``node`` into your virtual environment is as easy as::
        
            $ pip install virtual-node
        
        that should be it. You should now be able to run ``node`` from within
        your virtual environment even if you have it globally installed. You
        can make sure that this is the case::
        
            $ which node
            /home/elbaschid/.virtualenvs/lessc-test/bin/node
