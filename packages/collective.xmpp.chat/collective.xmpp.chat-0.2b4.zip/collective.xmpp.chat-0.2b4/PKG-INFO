Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        ``collective.chat.xmpp`` provides instant messaging for Plone_. It uses the 
        XMPP_ protocol and requires an XMPP server (such as ejabberd_) for the message handling.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Manually or automically subscribe to other users. 
        * With manual roster subscriptions, you can accept or decline contact requests.
        * Chat statuses (online, busy, away, offline)
        * Custom status message
        * Typing notifications (i.e when the contact is typing)
        * Third person messages (/me )
        * Multi-user chat in chatrooms
        * Topics can be set for chatrooms
        * Full name and profile picture support
        
        Installation
        ============
         
        XMPP integration with Plone is provided by the `collective.xmpp.core`_ package.
        Please refer to its README on how to set it up.
        
        You can use the buildout at `collective.xmpp.buildout`_.
        
        The buildout in this egg is used for development purposes.
        
        You'll need to have a working XMPP server and access to the 
        administration account on the server. 
        
        Your XMPP server will have to support the following extensions
        
        * `XEP-0045`_ Multi-user Chat
        * `XEP-0071`_ XHTML-IM.
        * `XEP-0144`_ Roster Item Exchange.
        * `XEP-0124`_ Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)
        * `XEP-0206`_ XMPP over BOSH
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        You'll need to have an administrator account on the Jabber server you'll be
        using. Refer to the `collective.xmpp.core`_ README for information on how to
        set this up.
        
        Once you've installed ``collective.xmpp.chat``, you should go to the Plone
        registry in the control panel and set the ``XMPP Domain`` as well as the ``XMPP
        Admin JID`` and ``XMPP Admin Password`` values.
        
        Additionally you have the option ``Auto-subscribe XMPP users``, which is
        disabled by default.
        
        Enable this option if you don't want your users to manually maintain their
        rosters (i.e subscribing and unsubscribing to one another) and would rather
        have everyone subscribe to everyone else. Be careful however, this might cause
        a lot of overhead (and therefore be quite slow) on sites with large userbases.
        
        Important details for developers
        ================================
        
        Since  `a recent commit`_ this package now makes
        use of a git submodule (specifically the the ./browser/resources dir).
        
        Once you have cloned this repo, you need to run two commands:
        
          :: 
        
            git submodule init
            git submodule update 
        
        For more information on submodules and how to work with them, `refer to the git book`_.
