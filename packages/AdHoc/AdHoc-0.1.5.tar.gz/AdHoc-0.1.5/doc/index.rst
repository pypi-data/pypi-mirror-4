AdHoc Standalone Python Script Generator
########################################

AdHoc consists of a single python source file `adhoc.py`, which can
be used as a program (see `Script Usage`_) as well as a module (see
:class:`adhoc.AdHoc`).

`adhoc.py` itself is distributed as a compiled adhoc script.

After installation of the binary package, run ``adhoc.py --explode``
to obtain the full source in directory ``__adhoc__``.


Purpose
=======

AdHoc provides python scripts with

- template facilities
- default file generation
- standalone module inclusion

Description
===========

:class:`adhoc.AdHoc` parses text for tagged lines and processes them
as instructions.

The minimal parsed entity is a tagged line, which is any line
containing a recognized `AdHoc` tag.

Tagged lines come in two flavors, namely flags and section delimiters.

All `AdHoc` tags are enclosed in |@:| and |:@|. E.g:

  |@:|\ adhoc\ |:@|

Flags are tagged lines, which denote a single option or command (see
`Flags`_). E.g.:

  | import module     # |@:|\ adhoc\ |:@|
  | # |@:|\ adhoc_self\ |:@| my_module_name

Sections are tagged line pairs, which delimit a block of text. The
first tagged line opens the section, the second tagged line closes
the section (see `Sections`_). E.g.:

  | # |@:|\ adhoc_enable\ |:@|
  | # disabled_command()
  | # |@:|\ adhoc_enable\ |:@|

The implementation is realized as class :class:`adhoc.AdHoc` which is mainly
used as a namespace. The run time part of :class:`adhoc.AdHoc` which handles
module import and file export is included verbatim as class
:class:`RtAdHoc` in the generated output.

Flags
-----

:|adhoc_run_time|:
    The place where the AdHoc run time code is added.  This flag must
    be present in files, which use the |adhoc| import feature.  It
    is not needed for the enable/disable features.

:|adhoc|:
    Mark import line for run-time compilation.

    This flag is ignored, if the line is commented out. E.g.:

      | # import module  # |adhoc|

.. _adhoc_include:

:|adhoc_include| file_spec, ...:
    Include files for unpacking. ``file_spec`` is one of

    :file:
      ``file`` is used for both input and output.

    :file ``from`` default-file:
      ``file`` is used for input and output. if ``file`` does not
      exist, ``default-file`` is used for input.

    :source-file ``as`` output-file:
      ``source-file`` is used for input. ``output-file`` is used
      for output.

    This flag is ignored, if double commented. E.g.:

      | # # |adhoc_include| file

:|adhoc_verbatim| [flags] file_spec, ...:
    Include files for verbatim extraction. See adhoc_include_ for
    ``file_spec``.

    The files are included as |adhoc_template_v| sections. `file` is used
    as `export_file` mark. If `file` is ``--``, the template disposition
    becomes standard output.

    Optional flags can be any combination of ``[+|-]NUM`` for
    indentation and ``#`` for commenting. E.g.:

      | # |adhoc_verbatim| +4# my_file from /dev/null

    `my_file` (or `/dev/null`) is read, commented and indented 4
    spaces.

    If the |adhoc_verbatim| tag is already indented, the specified
    indentation is subtracted.

    This flag is ignored, if double commented. E.g.:

      | # # |adhoc_verbatim| file

:|adhoc_self| name ...:
    Mark name(s) as currently compiling.  This is useful, if
    `__init__.py` imports other module parts. E.g:

      | import pyjsmo             # |@:|\ adhoc\ |:@|

    where ``pyjsmo/__init__.py`` contains:

      | # |@:|\ adhoc_self\ |:@| pyjsmo
      | from pyjsmo.base import * # |@:|\ adhoc\ |:@|

:|adhoc_compiled|:
    If present, no compilation is done on this file. This flag is
    added by the compiler to the run-time version.

Sections
--------

:|adhoc_enable|:
    Leading comment char and exactly one space are removed from lines
    in these sections.

:|adhoc_disable|:
    A comment char and exactly one space are added to lines in these
    sections.

:|adhoc_template| -mark | export_file:
    If mark starts with ``-``, the output disposition is standard output
    and the template is ignored, when exporting.

    Otherwise, the template is written to output_file during export.

    All template parts with the same mark/export_file are concatenated
    to a single string.

:|adhoc_template_v| export_file:
    Variation of |adhoc_template|. Automatically generated by |adhoc_verbatim|.

:|adhoc_uncomment|:
    Treated like |adhoc_enable| before template output.

:|adhoc_indent| [+|-]NUM:
    Add or remove indentation before template output.

:|adhoc_import|:
    Imported files are marked as such by the compiler. There is no
    effect during compilation.

:|adhoc_unpack|:
    Included files are marked as such by the compiler. There is no
    effect during compilation.

:|adhoc_remove|:
    Added sections are marked as such by the compiler.  The flag is
    renamed to |adhoc_remove_| during compilation.  Which in turn is
    renamed to |adhoc_remove| during export.

Internal
--------

:|adhoc_run_time_class|:
    Marks the beginning of the run-time class.  This is only
    recognized in the AdHoc programm/module.

:|adhoc_run_time_section|:
    All sections are concatenated and used as run-time code.  This is
    only recognized in the AdHoc programm/module.

\|:todo:| make enable/disable RX configurable
