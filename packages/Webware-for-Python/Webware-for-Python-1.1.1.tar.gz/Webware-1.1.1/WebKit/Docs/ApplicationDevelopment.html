<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>Here we describe best practices for developing a web application using Webware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-up-your-application">
<h1>Setting up your application</h1>
<p>The first task in developing an application is to set up the file structure in
which you will be working.</p>
<p>It is possible to put your application in a subdirectory under <tt class="docutils literal">WebKit/</tt> and
change <tt class="docutils literal">WebKit/Configs/Application.config</tt> to add another context.
But <em>do not do this</em>.  Your application will be entwined with the Webware
installation, making it difficult to upgrade Webware, and difficult to identify
your own files from Webware files.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-a-working-directory">
<h2>Creating a Working Directory</h2>
<p>Instead you should use the script <tt class="docutils literal">bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py</tt>.
You should run it like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ python Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir -c Context -l Lib --cvsignore WorkDir
</pre>
<p>This will create a directory <tt class="docutils literal">WorkDir</tt> that will contain a directory structure
for your application.  The options are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span> Context</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Use <tt class="docutils literal">Context</tt> as the name for the application default context.
A subdirectory with the same name will be created in the work dir (you can
change that with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></tt> option).
If you do not use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span></tt> option, the context name will be <tt class="docutils literal">MyContext</tt>.
I like the name <tt class="docutils literal">Context</tt> for all my applications.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> Lib</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Create a <tt class="docutils literal">Lib</tt> directory in the work dir which will be added to the Python
path.  You can use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span></tt> option multiple times; and you can also add
already existent library directories outside of the work dir.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--cvsignore</span></tt>:</dt>
<dd>Create <tt class="docutils literal">.cvsignore</tt> files for use with CVS.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">WorkDir</tt>:</dt>
<dd>The files will be put here.  Name if after your application, place it where
it is convenient for you -- it doesn't need to be located close to the
Webware installation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see all available options if you run <tt class="docutils literal">Webware/bin/MakeAppWorkDir.py</tt>
without any parameters.</p>
<p>When you do this, you'll see this directory structure:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
AppServer*  Configs/  error404.html  Launch.py  Logs/      WebKit.cgi
Cache/      Context/  ErrorMsgs/     Lib/       Sessions/  webkit*
</pre>
<p>Here's what the files and directories are for:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">AppServer</tt>:</dt>
<dd>The script to start up the AppServer for this application.
Each application will have its own AppServer, and its own process.
If you are running under Windows, you will see a <tt class="docutils literal">AppServer.bat</tt>
instead and additionally, you will find a <tt class="docutils literal">AppServerService.py</tt>
script that can be used to start the AppServer as a service.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Cache</tt>:</dt>
<dd>A directory containing cache files.  You won't need to look in here.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Configs</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Configuration files for the application.  These files are copied from
<tt class="docutils literal">WebKit/Configs</tt>, but are specific to this application/AppServer.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Context</tt>:</dt>
<dd>The directory for your default context.  This is where you put your servlets.
you can change its name and location with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">`-c</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></tt> options.
You can also change this subsequently in the <tt class="docutils literal">Application.config</tt> file
in the <tt class="docutils literal">Configs</tt> directory, where you can also configure more than one
context.  You may also want to remove the other standard contexts that come
with Webware from the config file.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">error404.html</tt>:</dt>
<dd>The static HTML page to be displayed when a page is not found.  You can
remove this to display a standard error message, modify the page according
to your preferences, or use a custom error servlet instead by setting
<tt class="docutils literal">ErrorPage</tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal">Application.config</tt> file appropriately.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">ErrorMsgs</tt>:</dt>
<dd>HTML pages for any errors that occur.  These can pile up and take up
considerable size (even just during development), so you'll want to
purge these every so often.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Launch.py</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Called by the <tt class="docutils literal">AppServer</tt> script to launch the AppServer.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Lib</tt>:</dt>
<dd>An example for an application-specific library package that can be created
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span></tt> option (in this case, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-l</span> Lib</tt>.  Import modules from this directory
like <tt class="docutils literal">from Lib.SitePage import SitePage</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Logs</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Logs of accesses.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Sessions</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Users sessions.  These should be cleaned out automatically, you won't
have to look in this directory.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">WebKit.cgi</tt>:</dt>
<dd>A CGI script/adapter for accessing the AppServer here.  You can still use
the other adapters, but most of them don't need to be configured for the
individual applications.  I still recommend <tt class="docutils literal">mod_webkit</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">wkcgi</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">webkit*</tt>:</dt>
<dd>If you are running under Unix, you can use this as a start script
(see the <a class="reference external" href="InstallGuide.html">WebKit Install Guide</a>).</dd>

<div class="section" id="using-a-version-control-system-for-your-application">
<h2>Using a version control system for your application</h2>
<p>A version control system is a useful tool for managing your application.  Popular
Open Source version control systems are are the Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
and, increasingly, Subversion (SVN).  I recommend using SVN because it has a few
advantages over CVS.  For instance, it tracks both files and directories and
handles copy, rename, and delete operations on files well.  These systems handle
versioning, but they also make it possible for other people to see snapshots of
your progress, for multiple developers to collaborate and work on an application
simultaneously, and they create a sort of implicit file share for your project.
Even if you are the only developer on an application, a version control system
can be very helpful.</p>
<p>The working directory is a good place to start for creating a versioned project.
Assuming you've set up CVS, and set CVSROOT to point to your repository, you can
get started by importing your project into the repository simply by running:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd WorkDir
$ cvs import -m 'initial import' MyWebwareProject username start
</pre>
<p>Replace <tt class="docutils literal">MyWebwareProject</tt> with the name of your project and <tt class="docutils literal">username</tt> with
your own user name.  You should use the option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--cvsignore</span></tt> when running
<tt class="docutils literal">MakeAppWorkDir.py</tt> if you plan to do this.  If you do, then <tt class="docutils literal">.cvsignore</tt>
files will be added to each directory.  These tell CVS to ignore files with
certain extensions (such as <tt class="docutils literal">.pyc</tt> files), and all the files in certain
directories (<tt class="docutils literal">Cache</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">ErrorMsgs</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">Logs</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">Sessions</tt>).
You shouldn't otherwise notice these files, even if you aren't using CVS.</p>
<p>The command to import your project into a SVN repository is very similar:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cd WorkDir
$ svn import  -m 'initial import' https://myserver/myrepos/MyWebWareProject
</pre>
<p>Replace <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://myserver/myrepos/</span></tt> with the URL of your SVN repository.
The <tt class="docutils literal">.cvsignore</tt> files will not be used in this case. Instead, you have to set
the <tt class="docutils literal">svn:ignore</tt> property on the respective directory.  You can still use the
<tt class="docutils literal">.cvsignore</tt> files to generate the necessary <tt class="docutils literal">svn propset</tt> commands:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ find . -name .cvsignore | while read f; \
&gt;   do echo svn propset svn:ignore -F $f $(dirname $f); done
</pre>
<p>After importing <tt class="docutils literal">WorkDir</tt> to the repository, note that it is not automatically
under version control.  To start working, you first need to explicitely check it
out from the repository using <tt class="docutils literal">cvs checkout</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">svn checkout</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-working-directory-from-multiple-accounts">
<h2>Using the working directory from multiple accounts</h2>
<p>If you are using a version control system or if you are otherwise distributing
your application code, you may find that it is difficult to manage the
differences between accounts.  For instance, in different accounts on different
machines Webware may be installed in different locations.  You may have the
actual directory in a different location as well -- it may be in
<tt class="docutils literal">~/webware/WorkDir</tt> for your active development, but <tt class="docutils literal">/var/webware/WorkDir</tt>
for the production version.  And if there are multiple development copies on the
same machine, you have to be sure they each use different adapter ports.</p>
<p>To solve these problems I recommend creating a shell script to handle startup.
I generally call this script <tt class="docutils literal">start</tt>, and it looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/sh

# lothlorien.colorstudy.com is my development machine
if [ `hostname` = lothlorien.colorstudy.com ] ; then
    WORKING=$HOME/prog/webware/WorkingDir
    WEBWARE=$HOME/prog/webware/Webware
    OPS=&quot;AppServer.AutoReload=1&quot;
fi

# this is my production environment
if [ `hostname` = color.colorstudy.com &amp;&amp; `whoami` = webware ] ; then
    WORKING=/www/WorkingDir
    WEBWARE=/www/Webware
    OPS=&quot;&quot;
fi

if [ &quot;$WORKING&quot; = &quot;&quot; ] ; then
    echo I do not recognize this environment
    exit 1
fi

cd $WORKING
./AppServer --work-dir=$WORKING --webware-dir=$WEBWARE $OPS $*
</pre>
<p>You can add this to your project in the repository, and the script should
automatically detect what environment it is being used in.  You can use options
to change configuration parameters, like setting some parameters depending on
whether the environment is a development or production environment.</p>
<p>Some options that you may be particularly interested in:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">AppServer.AutoReload</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Setting this to <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt> will make the AppServer restart if there have been
changes to any loaded files.  This is very nice during development.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">AppServer.AdapterPort</tt>:</dt>
<dd>If you want multiple applications running on the same machine (e.g., one
for development, one for production), you have to use different ports.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Application.ShowDebugInfoOnErrors</tt>:</dt>
<dd>You probably don't want to have this on in production, but it's nice
during development.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Application.SaveErrorMessages</tt>:</dt>
<dd>During development you probably want this off.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">Application.EmailErrors</tt>:</dt>
<dd>Turn on for production.</dd>

<div class="section" id="structuring-your-code">
<h1>Structuring your Code</h1>
<p>Once you've got the basic files and directories in place, you're ready to go in
and write some code.  Don't let this document get in the way of developing the
application how you choose, but here are some common patterns that have proven
useful for Webware applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="sitepage">
<h2>SitePage</h2>
<p>Subclass a <tt class="docutils literal">SitePage</tt> from <tt class="docutils literal">WebKit.Page</tt> for your application.  This subclass
will change some methods and add some new methods.  It serves as the basis and
as a template for all the pages that follow.</p>
<p>Some code you may wish to include in your <tt class="docutils literal">SitePage</tt>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Authentication and security</li>
<li>Accessing common objects (e.g., a user object, or a document object)</li>
<li>Page header and footer</li>
<li>Common layout commands, like <tt class="docutils literal">writeHeader</tt></li>
<li>Database access</li>
</ul>
<p>I also typically add other functions to the SitePage module, and then do
<tt class="docutils literal">from Lib.SitePage import *</tt> in each servlet -- this might include functions
like htmlEncode, or some other select functions that I use constantly in
web applications.  Whether you want to use functions or methods is up to you --
in many cases methods can be more easily extended or customized later, but
sometimes method use can become excessive and create unnecessary dependences
in your code.</p>
<p>A basic framework for your SitePage might be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from WebKit.Page import Page

class SitePage(Page):

    def respond(self, trans):
        if self.securePage():
            if not self.session().value('username', False):
                self.respondLogIn()
                return

    def securePage(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Override this method in your servlets to return True if the
        page should only be accessible to logged-in users -- by default
        pages are publically viewable&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return False

    def respondLogin(self):
        # Here we should deal with logging in...
        pass
</pre>
<p>Obviously there are a lot of details to add in on your own which are specific
to your application and the security and user model you are using.</p>
