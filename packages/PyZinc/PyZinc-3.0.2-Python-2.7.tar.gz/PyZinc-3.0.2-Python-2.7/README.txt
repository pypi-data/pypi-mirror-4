PyZinc
======

PyZinc provides a python interface to the Zinc visualisation library.  There are some examples of using PyZinc available at https://somwhere.like.here.  A typical usage often starts with creating a Context like this::

    #!/usr/bin/python

    from pyzinc import Context

    c = Context.Context.create("my-context")

There are some very cool things you can visualise with this library, like DICOM images, Hermite meshes and so on.

First Steps

The examples are the best place for getting started the PyZinc.
