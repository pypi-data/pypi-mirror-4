        ==================
        
        Multilingual Sites with Kotti_.
        
        Kotti's data model includes a ``language`` attribute on the ``Content`` class,
        from which all content types inherit.  However, this attribute is neither
        exposed by Kotti's UI, nor used in any other way.  ``kotti_multilingual``
        provides a generic approach to build multilingual sites.
        
        Work in Progress
        ================
        
        ``kotti_multilingual`` is still in an early stage of development.  It is
        neither feature complete nor can be considered API stable.  Things will change!
        
        Features
        ========
        
        The package contains a single content type ``LanguageSection`` which is
        supposed to be the container of all content in a specific language.  All
        content that is created in (or moved into) such a subtree will be automatically
        tagged with the language of the section.  This is done by subscribing to
        Kotti's ``ObjectInsert`` and ``ObjectUpdate`` events.
        
        You can place ``LanguageSection`` instances wherever you want in your content
        tree, but it is considered best practice to have a tree structure like this::
        
         - /            Document            language neutral
            - /en       LanguageSection     English
            - /de       LanguageSection     German
            - /nl       LanguageSection     Dutch
            - /images   Document            language neutral
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        To activate the ``kotti_multilingual`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to
        add an entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste Deploy config.
        If you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one.  The added entry
        should look like this::
        
            kotti.configurators = kotti_multilingual.kotti_configure
        
        .. _Kotti: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Kotti
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.1a2 - 2013-05-07
        ------------------
        
        -   Removed a lot of code that's now replaced by Kotti's ``INavigationRoot`` /
            ``TemplateAPI.navigation_root``.  This greatly simplifies the setup of
            ``kotti_multilingua``.
        
        -   Depend on Kotti>=0.9a3dev (needed for the above).
        
        0.1a1 - 2013-05-06
        ------------------
        
        -   Initial release.
