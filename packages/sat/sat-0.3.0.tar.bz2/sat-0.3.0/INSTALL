***
Below are the old manual instructions for installation, you can install SàT automatically using easy_install or pip. The full instructions are available on the wiki: http://wiki.goffi.org/wiki/Salut_%C3%A0_Toi
*** 


The following instructions are for GNU/Linux operating system. Instruction for other OS will come in the future.

/!\ WARNING /!\
SàT is at a very early developpement stage, and is not intended for end user yet. You need to understand a minimum what you do to install it. Anyway, you can contact me if you need help (but I'm really busy, so don't expect a quick and accurate answer).

** DEPENDENCIES:

To use SàT, you will need to install:
- twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) which is found in most distributions, at least core, web and words must be installed
- progressbar (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2) which can be installed with easy_install
- wokkel (http://wokkel.ik.nu/). /!\ the MUC branch (http://hg.ik.nu/ralphm/wokkel-muc-client-support-24-2) must be merged, please read instructions below
- wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org) which is found in most distributions. The more recent the version is, the better.
- urwid (http://excess.org/urwid/) which can be installed with easy_install
- Mutagen (http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/) which can be installed with easy_install

** PATHS:

You must have the main dir (with sat inside) and frontend in your PYTHONPATH. For example, if you have uncompressed the soft in /tmp/useless_soft:

> export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/tmp/useless_soft:/tmp/useless_soft/frontends

if you want to access jp, it can be a good idea to export its dir to your PATH variable:

> export PATH=$PATH:/tmp/useless_soft/frontends/jp


** INSTRUCTIONS:

Here are the instructions for the distribution I use (Kubuntu Karmic Koala), but instructions for other Gnu/Linux distributions must be really close.
To install SàT on a *buntu distribution, you first need to install dependencies:

> sudo aptitude install python-twisted python-twisted-core python-twisted-web python-twisted-words python-wxgtk2.8

You maybe need an updated repository for wxPython, take a look at http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian for more informations.

ProgressBar and Urwid can be installed with easy_install, or throught apt:
> sudo aptitude install python-progressbar python-urwid

Wokkel is a bit more complicated to install as we need to merge two branches:

First be sure that mercurial is installed
> sudo aptitude install mercurial

then we go to a directory where we can clone the repositories and merge. If you don't want to code on wokkel, you can do it in /tmp:

> cd /tmp
> hg clone http://hg.ik.nu/wokkel wokkel

now we pull the other branch:
> cd wokkel
> hg pull -f http://hg.ik.nu/ralphm/wokkel-muc-client-support-24-2

time to merge and commit:
> hg merge wokkel-muc-client-support-24
> hg commit -m "Merged wokkel's MUC branch"

finally,we can install:

> sudo python setup.py install

Everything is fine ? Ok let's add the paths.

If you use bash, you need probably to do something like
> echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/sat:~/sat/frontends" >> ~/.bashrc
> echo "export PATH=$PATH:~/sat/frontends/jp" >> ~/.bashrc

of course, replace ~/sat with the path where you installed SàT, and if you use zsh, replace .bashrc by .zshrc.
Restart a console or export manually the PATH.

Now everything should be OK, you can launch SàT. You have to launch the daemon first:
> cd ~/sat
> ./sat

You should be able to close you console or even X Window if you want.

Then launch one (ore more) frontend. For exemple, to use Wix:
> cd ~/sat/frontends/wix
> ./wix

enjoy =)
And don't hesitate to give feedback.
