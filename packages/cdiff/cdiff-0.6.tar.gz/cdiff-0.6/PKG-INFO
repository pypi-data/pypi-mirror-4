        Term based tool to view **colored**, **incremental** diff in *Git/Mercurial/Svn*
        workspace, given patch or two files, or from stdin, with **side by side** and
        **auto pager** support.  Requires python (>= 2.5.0) and ``less``.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with pip
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Cdiff is already listed on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cdiff>`_, you can
        install with ``pip`` if you have the tool.
        
        .. code:: sh
         
            pip install --upgrade cdiff
        
        Install with setup.py
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can also run the setup.py from the source if you don't have ``pip``.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            git clone https://github.com/ymattw/cdiff.git
            cd cdiff
            ./setup.py install
        
        Download directly
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Just save `cdiff.py <https://raw.github.com/ymattw/cdiff/master/cdiff.py>`_ to
        whatever directory which is in your ``$PATH``, for example, ``$HOME/bin`` is in
        my ``$PATH``, so I save the script there and name as ``cdiff``.
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            curl -ksS https://raw.github.com/ymattw/cdiff/master/cdiff.py > ~/bin/cdiff
            chmod +x ~/bin/cdiff
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Show usage:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cdiff -h
        
        Read diff from local modification in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cd proj-workspace
            cdiff                       # view colored incremental udiff
            cdiff -s                    # view side by side
            cdiff -s -w 90              # use text width 90 other than default 80
        
        Read the log (e.g. ``git log -p``) in a *Git/Mercurial/Svn* workspace:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cd proj-workspace
            cdiff -l
            cdiff -ls                   # equivalent to ``cdiff -l -s``
            cdiff -ls -w90
        
        Pipe in a diff:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            git log -p -2 | cdiff -s
            git show 15bfa5 | cdiff -s
            svn diff -r PREV | cdiff -s
        
        View a diff (patch) file:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cdiff foo.patch
            cdiff foo.patch -s
            cdiff foo.patch -s -w 90
        
        View diff between two files (wrapper of ``diff``):
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            cdiff foo foo.new           # equivalent to diff -u foo foo.new | cdiff
            cdiff foo foo.new -s
        
        Redirect output to another patch file is safe:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            svn diff -r PREV | cdiff -s > my.patch
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        - Verified on `travis <https://travis-ci.org/ymattw/cdiff>`_ with python 2.5,
          2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and pypy
        - Only takes unified diff for input
        - Side by side mode has alignment problem for wide chars
        - Pull requests are very welcome (please run ``make test`` to verify)

        --------
        
        I have another tool `coderev <https://github.com/ymattw/coderev>`_ which
        generates side-by-side diff pages for code review from two given files or
        directories, I found it's not easy to extend to support git so invented
        `cdiff`.  Idea of ansi color markup is also from project `colordiff
        <https://github.com/daveewart/colordiff>`_.
