Next releases goals
===================

Principles
==========

Since release 0.1.6 we have fixed all know bugs for the language. Although
we're still in the early stages of the project, we have moved to a beta release
cycle.

So we're a providing a list of goals to be meet for the next release. We're
willing to follow a Quality Based release cycle; meaning that we should make a
stable release until all known bug regarding main components and/or goals in
our backlog the target release are closed.

The following list a list of goals to be accomplished for next minor releases.
