list-open-workflow-executions
*****************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns a list of open workflow executions in the specified --domain
that meet the filtering criteria. The results may be split into
multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again
using the --next-page-token returned by the initial call.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* Constrain the following parameters by using a "Condition" element
  with the appropriate keys.

* "tag" : String constraint. The key is "swf:tagFilter.tag" .

* "typeFilter.name" : String constraint. String constraint. The key is
  "swf:typeFilter.name" .

* "typeFilter.version" : String constraint. String constraint. The key
  is "swf:typeFilter.version" .

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf list-open-workflow-executions
     --domain <value>
     --start-time-filter <value>
     [--next-page-token <value>]
     [--type-filter <value>]
     [--tag-filter <value>]
     [--execution-filter <value>]
     [--reverse-order ]
     [--maximum-page-size <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The name of the --domain that contains the workflow executions to
   list.

"--start-time-filter"  (structure)
   Workflow executions are included in the returned results based on
   whether their start times are within the range specified by this
   filter.

   "oldest_date"  (timestamp)

   "latest_date"  (timestamp)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "oldest_date": timestamp,
        "latest_date": timestamp
      }


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--next-page-token"  (string)
   If on a previous call to this method a "NextPageToken" was
   returned, the results are being paginated. To get the next page of
   results, repeat the call with the returned token and all other
   arguments unchanged.

"--type-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only executions of the type specified in the filter
   are returned.

   Note: "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter" and "--tag-filter" are
     mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a
     request.

   "version"  (string)

   "name"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "version": "string",
        "name": "string"
      }

"--tag-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only executions that have the matching tag are
   listed.

   Note: "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter" and "--tag-filter" are
     mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a
     request.

   "tag"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "tag": "string"
      }

"--execution-filter"  (structure)
   If specified, only workflow executions matching the workflow id
   specified in the filter are returned.

   Note: "--execution-filter" , "--type-filter" and "--tag-filter" are
     mutually exclusive. You can specify at most one of these in a
     request.

   "workflow_id"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "workflow_id": "string"
      }

"--reverse-order"  (boolean)
   When set to "true" , returns the results in reverse order. By
   default the results are returned in descending order of the start
   time of the executions.

"--maximum-page-size"  (integer)
   The maximum number of results returned in each page. The default is
   100, but the caller can override this value to a page size
   *smaller* than the default. You cannot specify a page size greater
   than 100. Note that the number of executions may be less than the
   maxiumum page size, in which case, the returned page will have
   fewer results than the --maximum-page-size specified.
