start-instances
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Starts an instance that uses an Amazon EBS volume as its root device.
Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be
quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute
resources are released and you are not billed for hourly instance
usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains,
continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS
volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time.

Note: Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store
  as its root device returns an error.
