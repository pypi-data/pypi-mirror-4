detach-vpn-gateway
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Detaches a VPN gateway from a VPC. You do this if you're planning to
turn off the VPC and not use it anymore. You can confirm a VPN gateway
has been completely detached from a VPC by describing the VPN gateway

You must wait for the attachment's state to switch to detached before
you can delete the VPC or attach a different VPC to the VPN gateway.
