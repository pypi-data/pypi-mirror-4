Description: ## About
        
        **django-zeropass allows users to login to your site without a password**.
        
        A user enters their email address.
        If a matching email is found in your `User` models, an email is
        dispatched that contains a link with a token, that when clicked, is verified and if successful the user is logged in. Simples.
