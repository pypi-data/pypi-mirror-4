REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--service-role-arn"  (string)
   The stack AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which
   allows OpsWorks to work with AWS resources on your behalf. You must
   set this parameter to the Amazon Resource --name (ARN) for an
   existing IAM role. If you create a stack by using the OpsWorks
   console, it creates the role for you. You can obtain an existing
   stack's IAM ARN programmatically by calling  describe-permissions .
   For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers .

"--source-stack-id"  (string)
   The source stack ID.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--name"  (string)
   The cloned stack name.

"--hostname-theme"  (string)
   The stack's host name theme, with spaces are replaced by
   underscores. The theme is used to generate hostnames for the
   stack's instances. By default, "--hostname-theme" is set to
   Layer_Dependent, which creates hostnames by appending integers to
   the layer's shortname. The other themes are:

   * Baked_Goods

   * Clouds

   * European_Cities

   * Fruits

   * Greek_Deities

   * Legendary_Creatures_from_Japan

   * Planets_and_Moons

   * Roman_Deities

   * Scottish_Islands

   * US_Cities

   * Wild_Cats

   To obtain a generated hostname, call "GetHostNameSuggestion" ,
   which returns a hostname based on the current theme.

"--use-custom-cookbooks"  (boolean)
   Whether to use custom cookbooks.

"--default-availability-zone"  (string)
   The cloned stack's Availability Zone. For more information, see
   Regions and Endpoints .

"--stack-region"  (string)
   The cloned stack AWS region, such as "us-east-1". For more
   information about AWS regions, see Regions and Endpoints

"--custom-cookbooks-source"  (structure)
   "username"  (string)
      The user name.

   "ssh_key"  (string)
      The repository's SSH key.

   "url"  (string)
      The source URL.

   "password"  (string)
      The repository's password.

   "type"  (string)
      The repository type.

   "revision"  (string)
      The application's version. OpsWorks enables you to easily deploy
      new versions of an application. One of the simplest approaches
      is to have branches or revisions in your repository that
      represent different versions that can potentially be deployed.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "username": "string",
        "ssh_key": "string",
        "url": "string",

        "type": "git"|"svn"|"archive"|"s3",
        "revision": "string"
      }

"--default-ssh-key-name"  (string)
   A default SSH key for the stack instances. You can override this
   value when you create or update an instance.

"--clone-app-ids"  (list of string)
   A list of source stack app IDs to be included in the cloned stack.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--clone-permissions"  (boolean)
   Whether to clone the source stack's permissions.

"--default-instance-profile-arn"  (string)
   The ARN of an IAM profile that is the default profile for all of
   the stack's EC2 instances. For more information about IAM ARNs, see
   Using Identifiers .

"--attributes"  (map)
   A list of stack attributes and values as key/value pairs to be
   added to the cloned stack.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "string": "string"
        ...
      }

"--custom-json"  (string)
   A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It is used to
   override the corresponding default stack configuration JSON values.
   The string should be in the following format and must escape
   characters such as '"'.: ""{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\":
   \"value2\",...}""

"--default-os"  (string)
   The cloned stack default operating system, which must be either
   "Amazon Linux" or "Ubuntu 12.04 LTS".
