Changelog
=========

0.0.11 (2012-10-18)
-------------------

- Do not check id as required field (fixes compatibility with
  Products.remember)


0.0.10 (2011-09-05)
-------------------

- zkaffold.xml importer now depends on "content" instead of "plone-final".
  Depending on "plone-final" means that portlets.xml gets imported before
  zkaffold builds the site, but portlets.xml uses content in the site. So
  we're chaning it to depend on "content" instead, which is plone's
  "Import the site's structure and content" step.


0.0.9 (2011-08-23)
------------------

- Add <groups> support in members.xml

- Remove unused import that was causing unpleasant side effects - bad python!

- Documentation updates


0.0.8 (2011-02-14)
------------------

- Automatically publish added content
