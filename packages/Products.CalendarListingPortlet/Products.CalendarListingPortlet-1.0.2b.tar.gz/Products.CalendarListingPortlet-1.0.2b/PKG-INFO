Description: Products.CalendarListingPortlet is a simple product that enables
        listing of events in a portlet, and a listing of all future events in
        a template linked to by the portlet.
        
        Currently it only displays events with the state internally_published,
        making it suitable for use within parts of the site that use the
        intranet_workflow.
