update-gateway-software-now
***************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

This operation updates the gateway virtual machine (VM) software. The
request immediately triggers the software update.

Note: When you make this request, you get a "200 OK" success response
  immediately. However, it might take some time for the update to
  complete. You can call describe-gateway-information to verify the
  gateway is in the "STATE_RUNNING" state.

Warning: A software update forces a system restart of your gateway. You can
  minimize the chance of any disruption to your applications by
  increasing your iSCSI Initiators' timeouts. For more information
  about increasing iSCSI Initiator timeouts for Windows and Linux, see
