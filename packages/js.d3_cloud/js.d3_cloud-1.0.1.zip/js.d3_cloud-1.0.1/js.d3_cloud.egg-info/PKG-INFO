        ***********
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages the `D3 Word Cloud Layout`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`D3 Word Cloud Layout`: https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.d3_cloud``) are published to some URL.  As a bonus, this
        library also packages up a minified version of the original JavaScript.
        
        Packaging
        =========
        
        The packaging is stored on GitHub at
        https://github.com/davidjb/js.d3_cloud. If you happen to come across a bug
        that corresponds to *packaging*, then please report it here. Pull requests are
        more than welcome if you're fixing something yourself -- the more help the
        better!
        
        Any other bugs that relate to the library itself should be directed to the
        original developers.
        
        Updating this package
        ---------------------
        
        This process requires installation of the package for development - the
        suggested method to do this is via the `Buildout` within this package:
        
            cd js.d3_cloud
            python boostrap.py
            ./bin/buildout
        
        For minification of resources to succeed, you require a Java installation as
        this process uses the YUI Compressor library (via the ``minify``
        and``yuicompressor`` Python packages).
        
        In order to obtain a newer version of of this library, do the following::
        
            pushd js/d3_cloud/resources
            wget https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/raw/master/d3.layout.cloud.js -O d3.layout.cloud.js
            wget https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud/raw/master/LICENSE -O LICENSE
            popd
            #Edit changelog, setup.py for versions, etc
            python setup.py minify_d3_cloud
            git commit -a -m "Updated for release 1.0.1"
            git push
        
        If you're doing this out in your own fork of the GitHub repository, then
        send through a pull request so everyone can benefit.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        You can import ``d3_cloud`` from ``js.d3_cloud`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.d3_cloud import d3_cloud
          >>> d3_cloud.need()
