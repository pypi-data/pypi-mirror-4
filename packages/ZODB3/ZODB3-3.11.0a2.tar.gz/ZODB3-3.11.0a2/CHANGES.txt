3.11.0a2 (2012-12-02)
=====================

Fixed: The ZODB3 "test" extra was inadvertently removed.

       Note that the text extra exists soley to allow other packages
       to use ``ZODB [test]`` in their test dependencies.

3.11.0a1 (2012-12-01)
=====================

ZODB3 depends on:

- persistent 4.0
- BTrees 4.0
- ZODB 4.0
- ZEO 4.0
