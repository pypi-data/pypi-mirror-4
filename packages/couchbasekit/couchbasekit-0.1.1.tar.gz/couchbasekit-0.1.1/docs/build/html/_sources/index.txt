couchbasekit
============

**couchbasekit** is `a wrapper around couchbase driver for document validation
and more`. It was inspired by `MongoKit <http://namlook.github.com/mongokit/>`_
and was developed by *the project coming soon?*, which is also an open
source project.

You can get detailed information about couchbase itself from
http://www.couchbase.com/ and about its Python driver form
