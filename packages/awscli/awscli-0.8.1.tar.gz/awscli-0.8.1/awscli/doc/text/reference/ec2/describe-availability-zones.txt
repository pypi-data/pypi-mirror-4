describe-availability-zones
***************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The describe-availability-zones operation describes availability zones
that are currently available to the account and their states.

Availability zones are not the same across accounts. The availability
zone "us-east-1a" for account A is not necessarily the same as "us-
east-1a" for account B. Zone assignments are mapped independently for
each account.

     [--zone-names <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for AvailabilityZones.
   For a complete reference to the available filter keys for this
   operation, see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

         "values"  (list of string)
            Contains one or more values for the filter.

         "name"  (string)
            Specifies the name of the filter.
