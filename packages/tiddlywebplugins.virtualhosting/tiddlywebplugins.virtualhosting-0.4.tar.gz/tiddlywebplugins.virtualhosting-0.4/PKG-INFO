Description: 
        This plugin overrides tiddlyweb.web.util:server_host_url to pay
        attention to the HTTP_HOST variable if it is present and use it for
        creating outgoing urls. By default the url provided by the server_host
        settings in config is used.
        
        This allows one TiddlyWeb server to support multiple hosts in a
        named virtual host kind of way.
