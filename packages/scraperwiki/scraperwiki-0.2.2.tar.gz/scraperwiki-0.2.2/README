Local ScraperWiki Python Library
====
This library aims to be a drop-in replacement for the Python `scraperwiki` library
for use locally. That is, functions will work the same way, and data will go
into a local SQLite database; a targeted bombing of ScraperWiki's servers
will not stop this local library from working, unless you happen to be running
it on one of ScraperWiki's servers.

## Installing

This will soon be in PyPI, but for now you can just install from the git repository.

## Documentation

Read the standard ScraperWiki Python library's [documentation](https://scraperwiki.com/docs/python/python_help_documentation/),
then look below for some quirks about the local version.

## Quirks

The local library aims to be a drop-in replacement.
In reality, the local version sometimes works better,
though not all of the features have been implemented.

## Differences

### Datastore differences

The local `scraperwiki.sqlite` is powered by
[DumpTruck](http://dumptruck.io), so some things
work a bit differently.

Data is stored to a local sqlite database named `scraperwiki.sqlite`.

Bizarre table and column names are supported.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.execute` will return an empty list of keys on an
empty select statement result.

`scraperwiki.sqlite.attach` downloads the whole datastore from ScraperWiki, the first time it runs; it then uses the cached database

### Other Differences

## Status of implementation
In general, features that have not been implemented raise a `NotImplementedError`.

### Datastore
`scraperwiki.sqlite` may implement some less explored features
of its API slightly differently from ScraperWiki.

### Geo
The UK geocoding helpers (`scraperwiki.geo`) documented on scraperwiki.com have been implemented. They partially depend on scraperwiki.com being available.

<!-- They have also been released as a separate library (ukgeo). Not true yet. -->

### Utils
`scraperwiki.utils` is implemented, as well as the following functions.

* `scraperwiki.log`
* `scraperwiki.scrape`
* `scraperwiki.pdftoxml`
* `scraperwiki.swimport`

### Deprecated
These submodules are deprecated and thus will not be implemented.

* `scraperwiki.apiwrapper`
* `scraperwiki.datastore`
* `scraperwiki.jsqlite`
* `scraperwiki.metadata`
* `scraperwiki.newsql`

### Development

Run tests with `./runtests`; this small wrapper cleans up after itself.

### Specs
Here are some ScraperWiki scrapers that demonstrate the non-local library's quirks.
