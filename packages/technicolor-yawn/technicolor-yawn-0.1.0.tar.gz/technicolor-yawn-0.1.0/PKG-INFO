        Technicolor Yawn colours and filters the request logs from the Google App
        Engine dev server. It's pretty rough at the moment and still contains Khan
        Academy specific stuff.
        
        Usage:
        
            dev_appserver.py --debug /path/to/your/app 2>&1 | technicolor-yawn
        
        Then your log will look something like this:
