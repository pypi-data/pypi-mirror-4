        **Sphinxit** is light and powerful **SphinxQL** query constructor. More, it is the set of helpers
        to make search with `Sphinx <http://sphinxsearch.com/>`_ easy to use in any kind of Python projects 
        like Django, Flask and others. Sphinxit is independent Python library and you are free to use it 
        anywhere you need powerful Sphinx-based search. 
        
        Make full-text queries, filtering, ordering, grouping and aggregating your search results. 
        Forget about deprecated Sphinx API or unpredictable non-tested batteries. Sphinxit is just better.
