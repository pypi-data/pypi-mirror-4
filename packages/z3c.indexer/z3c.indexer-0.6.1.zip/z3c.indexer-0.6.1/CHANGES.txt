CHANGES
=======

0.6.1 (2012-11-17)
------------------

- Feature: implemented TextIndex with family64 BTree support which makes it
  possible to use long as index ids. Added tests for the new TextIndex64.


0.6.0 (2009-02-22)
------------------

- Feature: Add support for sorting by indexed values, introduced in
  zope.index 3.5.0. See description of the ``searchResults`` method
  of ISearchQuery.

- Bugfix: Make query object constructor work with index name
  passed as unicode as well as with str.

- Mention ``searchResultFactory`` argument in the ``searchResults`` method
  of the ISearchQuery interface.

- Added the "subscriber.zcml" file that contains ZCML-based intid subscriber
  registrations for easy including in projects that use event-based indexing.

- The IIndexValue interface and all its mentions in code and documentation
  is removed, because it's not an actual part of concept and wasn't ever
  used/implemented in this package. It's easy to implement it in custom
  project, so we believe that it's not a problem.

- Reworded package description to make it nicer. Fix little docstring typos.

- Use new lightweight and ZMI-less versions of packages: zope.keyreference,
  zope.intid, zope.site, zope.container and zope.catalog (for tests).


0.5.1 (2008-12-11)
------------------

- Bugfix: SearchQuery wasn't able to act correct if initialized with query=None
  because of an empty result setup. The And() and Not() methods could not act
  correctly with this an empty initilized result.

- Bugfix: SearchQuery.And() and Not() didn't return an empty result if previous
  or given query result was empty. The previous result was returned.

- Feature: implemented new indexing strategy which uses transaction and thread
  local for prevent to index an object more then once per transaction.

- Bugfix: performance tests, not query did not show the right timer in catalog
  cell.

- Feature: added optional searchResultFactory. This class get used as a search
  result wrapper. By default the ResultSet class get used.

- Feature: Expose SearchQuery.results property. Ensure that we return always an
  empty result if None is given and allow to override existing results as a
  part of the SearchQuery API.

- Feature: Implemented optional intids argument in SearchQuery.searchResults
  method. This intids is used instead of query the IntIds util. This is usefull
  if you use builtin IIntIds objects for optimized access.

- Added __repr__ for ResultSet with result lenght.

- Optimized SearchQuery.And() and Not() methods. Skip given query processing
  if previous result is empty.

- Code is now 100% covered by tests.


0.5.0 (2008-05-02)
------------------

- Initial release
