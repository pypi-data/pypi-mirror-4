update-access-key
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Changes the status of the specified access key from Active to
Inactive, or vice versa. This action can be used to disable a user's
key as part of a key rotation work flow.

If the "--user-name" field is not specified, the --user-name is
determined implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID used to sign the
request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, this API can be used to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.

For information about rotating keys, see Managing Keys and
Certificates in *Using AWS Identity and Access Management* .
