        * Setup is now performed by setting "hostname" in the snurtle shell rather than "uri".  So just enter something like "coils.example.com:8080".  A "secure" shell settable is also now supported; if the value of "secure" evaluates to True than an HTTPS URI is generated for communication, otherwise an HTTP URI use used.
