        ==================================
        
        A Pinax theme + based on `Zurb Foundation`_
        Foundation is a popular CSS framework that is light weight, but includes
        all the basics such as; a responsive grid, forms, dialog, navigation tabs,
        buttons, typography and so on.

        Foundation  and how to use  it for rapid prototyping in this `article`_.

        What's New
        ------------
        
        - This release supports Foundation 3.1 which includes features such as
          right-to-left language support, new UI Styles for Progress Bars
          and Image Thumbs, updated jQuery and so on, read more about 3.1
          `here <http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/support.php>`_
        - Fully utilize the Foundation 3.1 responsive Top
          Navigation bar rather than our home grown solution
        - Included Icon Fonts, Responsive Tables and SVG Social Icons
          Zurb add-ons which are not part of core release
        - Lay the groundwork for supporting the `--template`
          flag on the `django-admin.py start project` in the next release
        
        
        Quickstart
        -----------
        Create a virtual environment for your project and activate it::
        
            $ virtualenv mysite-env
            $ source mysite-env/bin/activate
            (mysite-env)$
        
        Next install Pinax::
        
            (mysite-env)$ pip install Pinax
        
        Once Pinax is installed use **pinax-admin**  to create a project for your site
        ::
        
            (mysite-env)$ pinax-admin setup_project mysite -b basic mysite
        
        The example above will create a starter Django project in the mysite folder based on the Pinax **basic** project.
        Of course you can use any of the Pinax starter Projects.
        The **basic** project provides features such as account management, user profiles and notifications.
        The starter project also comes with a **theme** or a collection css, javascript files.
        The default theme is based on Twitter Bootstrap.
        
        To use the **Foundation** theme in the project, include "pinax-theme-foundation" in requirements/project.txt.
        Either install the package individually. ::
        
            pip install pinax-theme-foundation
        
        Or use the requirements file::
        
            pip install -r requirements/project.txt
        
        
        Next edit the **settings.py** file and
        comment out the entry for "pinax_theme_bootstrap" and add "pinax_theme_foundation" in your INSTALLED APPS::
        
            # theme
            #"pinax_theme_bootstrap",
            "pinax_theme_foundation",
        
        Inside your project run::
        
            (mysite-env)$ python manage.py syncdb
            (mysite-env)$ python manage.py runserver
        
        
        Templates
        ^^^^^^^^^^
        The Pinax *setup_project* creates a *site_base.html* template which extends *theme_base.html*.
        You own templates should normally inherit from *site_base.html*.  However, due to
        inconsistencies between Bootstrap and Foundation you may need to perform an additional step
        to ensure that the top nav bar is styled properly.
        If have created a **basic** starter project
        edit the generated *site_base.html* to remove the extra
        *ul* tags found in the *{% nav block %}*. In the *basic* project  *{% nav block %}* contains profile and notices dropdown menu items.
        The project  *site_base.html*  will contain ::
        
            {% block nav %}
        		{% if user.is_authenticated %}
        		<ul>{% spaceless %}
        			<li id="tab_profile"><a href="{% url profile_detail user.username %}">{% trans "Profile" %}</a></li>
        			<li id="tab_notices"><a href="{% url notification_notices %}">{% trans "Notices" %}{% if notice_unseen_count %} ({{ notice_unseen_count }}){% endif %}</a></li>
        			{% endspaceless %}
        		 </ul>
        		{% endif %}
           {% endblock %}
        
        Remove the *ul* tags so the block looks like ::
        
        	 {% block nav %}
        		{% if user.is_authenticated %}
        			<li id="tab_profile"><a href="{% url profile_detail user.username %}">{% trans "Profile" %}</a></li>
        			<li id="tab_notices"><a href="{% url notification_notices %}">{% trans "Notices" %}{% if notice_unseen_count %} ({{ notice_unseen_count }}){% endif %}</a></li>
        		{% endif %}
        	  % endblock %}
        
        
        
        You should provide your own "footer" template _footer.html
        
        Also change the Site name by editing *fixture/initial_data.json*  you can also use the Admin app for this purpose.
        The **url** name "home" should be defined as the homepage.
        
        
        Upgrading Previous Version
        ---------------------------------------------
        To upgrade you site start by upgrading to the latest version on pinax-theme-foundation ::
        
            pip install -- upgrade pinax-theme-foundation
        
        The big change between Foundation 2 to 3 is the grid. In Foundation 3 you no longer have to use *.container*
        to define the grid. In Foundation 2 the grid was built around
        *.container > .row > .columns* in Foundation 3 you now just have to use *.row > .columns*.
        In Foundation 3 padding and borders no longer increase the width of an element,
        they only go inward so for example in Foundation 3 .three.columns always has a width of 25%
        with a 15px padding on the left and right.
        You can find the Foundation 3 migration guide `here <http://foundation.zurb.com/migration.php>`_
        Remove all **max-width** from css sytling
        
        
        
        
        .. end-here
