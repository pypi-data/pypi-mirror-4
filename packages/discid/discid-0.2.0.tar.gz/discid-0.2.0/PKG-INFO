Description: Libdiscid Python bindings
        -------------------------
        
        **important note**:
        The API is still in development and might change until 1.0.0!
        
        Python-discid implements Python bindings for MusicBrainz Libdiscid. This
        module works with Python >= 2.6, including Python 3.
        
        Libdiscid's main purpose is the calculation of an identifier of audio
        discs (disc id) to use for the MusicBrainz database.
        
        That identifier is calculated from the TOC of the disc, similar to the
        freeDB CDDB identifier. Libdiscid can calculate MusicBranz Disc IDs and
        freeDB Disc IDs.
        
        This module is a very close binding that offloads all relevant data
        storage and calculation to Libdiscid. On the other hand it gives a
        pythonic API and uses an object and exceptions.
        
        For more information on Libdiscid see `libdiscid`_.
        
        For more information about the calculation of these disc ids see `Disc
        ID Calculation`_.
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            # this will load Libdiscid
            from discid import DiscId
        
            with DiscId() as disc:
                disc.read("/dev/cdrom")
                print "id: %s" % disc.get_id()  # Python 2
                print("id: %s" % disc.get_id()) # Python 3
        
        See also examples.py.

        Known Issues
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - The API is incomplete.
          I will complete it when the base API is decided and stable.
        - The Documentation missing.
          It will be created when the base API works.
        
        For other things you can submit tickets at `Github`_.
        The API is still subject to change.
