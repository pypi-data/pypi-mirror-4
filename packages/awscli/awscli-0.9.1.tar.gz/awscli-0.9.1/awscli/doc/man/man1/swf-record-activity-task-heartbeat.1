.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Used by activity workers to report to the service that the  ActivityTask
represented by the specified \fB\-\-task\-token\fP is still making progress. The
worker can also (optionally) specify \-\-details of the progress, for example
percent complete, using the \fB\-\-details\fP parameter. This action can also be
used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested
for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified
task, then the boolean \fBcancelRequested\fP flag returned by the service is set
to \fBtrue\fP .
.sp
This action resets the \fBtaskHeartbeatTimeout\fP clock. The
\fBtaskHeartbeatTimeout\fP is specified in  register\-activity\-type .
.sp
This action does not in itself create an event in the workflow execution
history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history will
contain a \fBActivityTaskTimedOut\fP event that contains the information from the
last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.
.IP Note
The \fBtaskStartToCloseTimeout\fP of an activity type is the maximum duration of
an activity task, regardless of the number of  record\-activity\-task\-heartbeat
requests received. The \fBtaskStartToCloseTimeout\fP is also specified in
register\-activity\-type .
.RE
.IP Note
This operation is only useful for long\-lived activities to report liveliness
of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being attempted.
.RE
.IP Warning
If the \fBcancelRequested\fP flag returns \fBtrue\fP , a cancellation is being
attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with
respond\-activity\-task\-canceled . Otherwise, it should ignore the cancellation
request.

\fBAccess Control\fP
.sp
You can use IAM policies to control this action\(aqs access to Amazon SWF resources
as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Use a \fBResource\fP element with the domain name to limit the action to only
specified domains.
.IP \(bu 2
Use an \fBAction\fP element to allow or deny permission to call this action.
.IP \(bu 2
You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action\(aqs parameters.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the
parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails by
throwing \fBOperationNotPermitted\fP . For \-\-details and example IAM policies, see
\fI\%Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows\fP
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-task\-token\fP  (string)
The \fB\-\-task\-token\fP of the  ActivityTask .
.IP Warning
The \fB\-\-task\-token\fP is generated by the service and should be treated as an
opaque value. If the task is passed to another process, its \fB\-\-task\-token\fP
must also be passed. This enables it to provide its progress and respond
with results.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-details\fP  (string)
If specified, contains \-\-details about the progress of the task.
