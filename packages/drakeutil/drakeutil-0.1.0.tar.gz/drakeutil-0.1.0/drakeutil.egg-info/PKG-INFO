        drakeutil
        =========
        
        Utilities for making life easier in Python with Drake_ workflows.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        Run ``pip install drakeutil``.
        
        Using
        =====
        
        For Python steps inside your workflow include the line::
        
            from drakeutil import *
        
        This will populate the special family of variables ``INPUT``, ``OUTPUT`` from the environment. For example::
        
            somefile.out <- somefile.in [python]
                from drakeutil import *
                with open(INPUT) as istream:
                    with open(OUTPUT) as ostream:
                        for l in istream:
                            for word in l.split():
                                print >> ostream, word
        
        In the future we might add more helpers. Can you think of any that would be useful?
