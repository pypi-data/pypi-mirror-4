Description: Introduction
        ============

        by providing it with a complete listing of content URLs to website.
        
        .. figure:: http://quintagroup.com/services/plone-development/products/google-sitemaps/plone-google-sitemaps.png
        
        Plone Google Sitemaps allows you to enable different kinds of Google Sitemaps on your Plone website. 
        Such Sitemaps help Google identify site URLs and the data under each site section. With Google Sitemaps
        enabled, search engines could track your Plone site URLs faster and more efficiently, optimizing their 
        search by placing all the information on one page.
        
        With Plone Google Sitemaps product you can enable following Sitemap types on your Plone website:
        
        * ``Content Sitemap`` - is a regular list of pages on your website. Creating and submitting such a Sitemap 
          lets Google know about all the pages on your Plone website, including URLs that may not be discoverable
          by Google's normal crawling process.
        * ``Mobile Sitemap`` - is a specific type of Sitemap, that indexes all site URLs that serve mobile-oriented content.
        * ``News Sitemap`` - is different from regular Sitemaps, since it is specific to Google News only.
          It uses the Sitemap protocol, with additional News-specific tags, defined by Google. The package brings protocol with 
          additional Google Sitemaps tab to News Item content type for defining NewsSitemap-specific meta tags. 
        
        Different Sitemap types index their own content and do not depend on other Sitemaps. 
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To enable Google Sitemaps on your site:

        ------------------
        
        * Updated modification date in Sitemaps for folderish objects which have

          Sitemap types have their own index (sitemap_date) 
          which helps to generate Sitemaps without default pages. 
          Index contains the last modification date from this object or  
          from default page. As а result you will not see default pages 
          in sitemap types.
