        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `smoke.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`smoke.js`: https://github.com/jyoungblood/smoke.js
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original smoke.js is published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import smoke_js from ``js.smoke`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.smoke import smoke_js
          >>> smoke_js.need()
        
        You can optionally specify which theme you want to use, where the default
        theme is included when you do not specify a theme::
        
          >>> from js.smoke import smoke_js, css, theme_100s, theme_dark, theme_tiger
          >>> smoke_js.need() # use default theme
          >>> smoke_js.need({css: theme_100s})
          >>> smoke_js.need({css: theme_dark})
          >>> smoke_js.need({css: theme_tiger})
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
