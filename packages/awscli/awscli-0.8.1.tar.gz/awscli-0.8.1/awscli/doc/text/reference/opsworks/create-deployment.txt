create-deployment
*****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deploys a stack or app.

* App deployment generates a "deploy" event, which runs the associated
  recipes and passes them a JSON stack configuration object that
  includes information about the app.

* Stack deployment runs the "deploy" recipes but does not raise an
  event.

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--stack-id"  (string)
   The stack ID.

"--comment"  (string)
   A user-defined comment.

"--custom-json"  (string)
   A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It is used to
   override the corresponding default stack configuration JSON values.
   The string should be in the following format and must escape
   characters such as '"'.: ""{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\":
   \"value2\",...}""

"--command"  (structure)
   A "DeploymentCommand" object that describes details of the
   operation.

   "args"  (map)
      An array of command arguments. This parameter is currently used
      only to specify the list of recipes to be executed by the
      "ExecuteRecipes" command.

   "name"  (string)
      Specifies the deployment operation. You can specify only one
      command.

      For stacks, the available commands are:

      * ExecuteRecipes: Execute the recipes that are specified by the
        "Args" parameter.

      * InstallDependencies: Installs the stack's dependencies.

      * UpdateCustomCookbooks: Update the stack's custom cookbooks.

      * UpdateDependencies: Update the stack's dependencies.

      For apps, the available commands are:

      * "DeployApp" : Deploy the app.

      * "RollbackApp" Roll the app back to the previous version. When
        you update an app, OpsWorks stores the previous version, up to
        a maximum of five versions. You can use this command to roll
        an app back as many as four versions.

      * "StartApp" : Start the app's web or application server.

      * "StopApp" : Stop the app's web or application server.

      * "UndeployApp" : Undeploy the app.
