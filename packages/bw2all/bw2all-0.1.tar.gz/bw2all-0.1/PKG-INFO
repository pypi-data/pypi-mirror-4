Description: =========================================
        Install the complete Brightway2 framework
        =========================================
        
        This is a wrapper for the separate packages that make up the Brightway2 life cycle assessment framework. It installs all Brightway2 components and their dependencies:
        
        * brightway2
        * bw2calc
        * bw2ui
        * bw2analyzer
        * progressbar
        * flask
        * nose
        * docopt
        * voluptuous
        
        SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib will also bw installed, but because they can be difficult to install correctly, it is recommended to install them using a prepackaged distribution like Python (x,y) or a package manager like macpors (Mac OS X) or apt (Debian/Ubuntu). See the Brightway2 documentation for more details. If you want to program with or use the more advanced features of Brightway2, then you should use the advanced installation.
