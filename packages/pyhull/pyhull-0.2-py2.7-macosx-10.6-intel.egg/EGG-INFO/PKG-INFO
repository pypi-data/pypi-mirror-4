Description: 
        pyhull is a port of Qhull (http://www.qhull.org/) as a Python extension. It
        is currently in an extremely early alpha, and only a very limited subset of
        functions are supported.
        
        The reason for this package is that there is currently no effective port of
        the qhull algorithm. While isolated packages exist for up to 3D convex hulls,
        no effective package exist for higher dimensions. The only other known code
        which supports convex hulls in higher dimension is the scipy.spatial
        package, but that code is extremely inefficient compared to the original
        Qhull in C.
