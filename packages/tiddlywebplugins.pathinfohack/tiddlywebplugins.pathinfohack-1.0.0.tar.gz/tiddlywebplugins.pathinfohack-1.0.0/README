A TiddlyWeb plugin that remedies an URI encoding problem
encountered when running TiddlyWeb under Apache.
The plugin reverts the path in the PATH_INFO variable
to its undecoded form.

The problem being addressed occurs with URIs containing
%2F characters (encoded forward slashes).

Currently Apache supplies the PATH_INFO variable in decoded form.
As a result, all instances of %2F in the URI are replaced
with a / character in PATH_INFO. The Selector is then
thrown off since it depends on forward slashes to match
handlers. No match, and the requested PUT, GET, DELETE,
etc., operation goes unhandled.

Install the plugin by adding 'tiddlywebplugins.pathinfohack' to
'system_plugins' in tiddlywebconfig.py.

config = {
    'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.pathinfohack'],
}
