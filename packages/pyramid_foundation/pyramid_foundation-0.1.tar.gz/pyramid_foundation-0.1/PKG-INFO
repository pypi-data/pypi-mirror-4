Description: `pyramid_foundation <http://github.com/ppinette/pyramid_foundation>`_
        ============================================================================
        
        This package provides a Pyramid scaffold which includes `Zurb Foundation <http://foundation.zurb.com/>`_
        
        pyramid_foundation is intended to extend other scaffolds such as starter or alchemy. Using it alone will not create a Pyramid project.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
            $ pcreate -s <scaffold> -s pyramid_foundation <project_name>
        
        Your newly created project will have the Foundation files located in Project/package/static/ 
        
        Additionally, mytemplate.pt has been modified to include the Foundation CSS and JS along with the standard basic introduction to Foundation. 
        
        Currently, pyramid_foundation provides the full foundation.css as well as the per-component files. Future support for SASS/Compass is planned.
