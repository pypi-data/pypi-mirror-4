HDHOMERUN recorder
==================

Description:
============
    A python program to record TV programs using hdhomerun tuner device.
    This should run on any system capable of running python and
    hdhomerun_config binary program.

    The hdhomerun tuner doesn't need much processing power for recording
    a program. So this is mainly intended for embedded systems. I used it
    on my WDTV Live media player. Now I use it on my pogoplug running
    arch Linux.

INSTALL:
========
    1. Install python if you don't have it already
    2. Install apscheduler from here. The old version of apscheduler has
        some issues, so be sure to install the latest V2 version.
        (https://bitbucket.org/agronholm/apscheduler)
    3. Install this package.
       If you have "pip", do "pip install hdhomerun-recorder"
       			OR
       If you have "easy_install". do "easy_install install hdhomerun-recorder"
       			OR
       You can manually download the source from PyPI
       (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hdhomerun-recorder), extract and
       then install it using: "python setup.cfg install"

    4. Create config-file
       a) Run /usr/bin/hdhomerun_recorder_setup /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/config-file
	  This will ask few question and write your tuner and channel
	  mappings into /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/config-file file. This
	  will take some time as it scans your local channels

	  See /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/config-file.example to see how an
	  example config file looks like. You may need to create one by
	  hand if the above script fails to create one for any reason!
    5. Edit schedule file
       See /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/schedule-file.example for details.
       You have given schedule-file location in the config-file. Edit
       that file with what and when you want to record etc.
    6. Run /usr/bin/hdhomerun_recorder /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/config-file

    7. Optional: See the logfile for information or errors.
    8. Optional. I have included /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/hdhomerun_recorder.service
       file that can be used to automatically start the recording daemon
       on reboot.  You can stop, start and reload the daemon. The
       "reload" option is useful when you update schedule file and you
       want the daemon to use the changes. Of course, this only works if
       you have systemd based start up (latest Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch
       distros will have)!

       a) Install service
          cp /etc/hdhomerun_recorder/hdhomerun_recorder.service /etc/systemd/system/
       b) Enable the service
          systemctl enable hdhomerun_recorder.service
       c) Start the service now
          systemctl start hdhomerun_recorder.service

       Run "systemctl reload hdhomerun_recorder.service" whenever you change your schedule-file!
