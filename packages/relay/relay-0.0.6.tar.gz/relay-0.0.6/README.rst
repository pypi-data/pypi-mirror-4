relay
========

Meta-magical SSH tunnels for remote developers behind firewalls.

Currently allows for sharing SSH connections (for collaborating in tmux+vim) and for sharing local development webservers.

Install
--------

Relay can be installed in a virtualenv, but we recommend installing it with sudo so it is always available::

    sudo pip install relay

General setup
-------------

*(nprapps users see the next section)*

Relay uses a configuration file located at `~/.relay.conf`. Create this file with contents such as:

.. code:: ini

    [relay]

    # User to connect to the relay server as
    user = ubuntu
    server = relay_server.your_domain.com
    private_key = /path/to/your/private_key
    public_key = /path/to/your/public_key.pub
    pair_user = relay
    ports_json = /path/to/your/ports.json
    bash_profile = /path/to/your/bash_profile

`ports.json` is a mapping of user's local ports to remote ports on the server, so that users will never collide when creating SSH tunnels. Create this file with contents such as:

.. code:: javascript

    {
        "chris": {
            "22": "2222",
            "8000": "8000"
        },
        "katie": {
            "22": "2223",
            "8000": "8001"
        },
    }

You then need to create a `relay` user. This process is automated::

    relay setup

NPRApps setup
-----------------

Pre-baked configuration files are in our Dropbox folder. You must have Dropbox installed, syncing to `~/Dropbox` and the `nprapps` shared folder synced to your local computer. Then run::

    ln -s ~/Dropbox/nprapps/relay/relay.conf ~/.relay.conf
    relay setup

Sharing SSH
------------------

To share your SSH connection (for tmux'ing), open a new terminal (or tab or tmux pane)::

    relay user:$USER share:22

Where `$USER` is your username in `ports.json`.

To connect to a shared SSH connection::

    relay user:$USER ssh

Where `$USER` is the username in `ports.json` of the user sharing the connection.

Sharing development webserver
-----------------------------

To share your local development webserver, open a new terminal (or tab or tmux pane)::

    relay user:$USER share:8000

Where `$USER` is your username in `ports.json`.

To connect open a shared webserver in your browser::

    relay user:$USER web

Where `$USER` is the username in `ports.json` of the user sharing the webserver.
