        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `AngularUI`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`AngularUI`: http://angular-ui.github.com/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.angular_ui``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``angular_ui`` from ``js.angular_ui`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.angular_ui import angular_ui
          >>> angular_ui.need()
        
        or ``angular_ui_ieshiv``
        
          >>> from js.angular_ui import angular_ui_ieshiv
          >>> angular_ui_ieshiv.need()
