Overview
=========

MetaChecka is a metagenomic QA toolset. It uses sets of reference
genes to test for bin completeness and contamination

Installation
=========

Should be as simple as

    pip install MetaChecka2000

Data preparation and running MetaChecka2000
=========

MetaChecka2000 expects to see a folder containing one or more multiple fasta 
files containg assembled and binned contigs, one file for each bin.

You need to:

  1. Extract genes from the contigs
  2. Use hmmer to match these genes to an existing database
  3. Do some counting

Use: metachecka2000 -h for more detailed help
