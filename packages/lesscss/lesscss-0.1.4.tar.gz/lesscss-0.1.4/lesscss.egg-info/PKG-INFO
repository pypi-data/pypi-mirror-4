        About
        =====
        
        LessCSS is a helper which automatically compiles LESS files to CSS when LESS
        files are modified. It works with Brubeck, web.py and bottle web frameworks. It
        should work with other framework without any problems though it's not tested.
        
        **Note:** You need to install LESS before using this.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install lesscss
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        An example usage
        
        ::
        
            from lesscss import LessCSS
            LessCSS(media_dir='media', exclude_dirs=['img', 'src'], based=True, compression='x')
        
        
        Parameters
        ==========
        
        - **media_dir:** Directory where you put static/media files such as css/js/img.
        - **exclude_dirs:** Directories you don't want to be searched. It'd be pointless to search for less files in an images directory. This parameter is expected to be a list.
        - **based:** If it's set True then LessCSS will generate the style-(base60).css version as well (for example; style-dHCFD.css). This is useful if you set expire times of static files to a distant future since browsers will not retrieve those files unless the name is different or the cache has expired. This parameter is expected to be a boolean value.
        - **compressed**: If it's set `True` then LessCSS will minimize the generated CSS files. This parameter is expected to be a boolean value.
        - **compression**: Specifies the type of compression to use. Default to the normal compression, 'x'. Other option is to use the YUI Compressor. See "Command-line Usage" at http://lesscss.org/.
        - **output_dir:** Directory where you put compiled CSS files if different than location of .less file.
