upload-server-certificate
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Uploads a server certificate entity for the AWS account. The server
certificate entity includes a public key certificate, a private key,
and an optional certificate chain, which should all be PEM-encoded.

For information about the number of server certificates you can
upload, see Limitations on IAM Entities in *Using AWS Identity and
Access Management* .

Note: Because the body of the public key certificate, private key, and the
  certificate chain can be large, you should use POST rather than GET
  when calling "upload-server-certificate" . For information about
  setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to
  Signing AWS API Requests in the *AWS General Reference* . For
  general information about using the Query API with IAM, go to Making
  Query Requests in *Using IAM* .
