The Advanced Recording Format (*ARF*) is an open standard for storing data from
neuronal and behavioral experiments in a portable, high-performance, archival
format. The goal is to enable labs to share data and tools, and to allow
valuable data to be accessed and analyzed for many years in the future.

*ARF* is built on the the [[http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/][HDF5]] format, and all arf files are accessible through
standard HDF5 tools, including interfaces to HDF5 written for other languages
(e.g. MATLAB, Python, etc). *ARF* comprises a set of specifications on how
different kinds of data are stored. The organization of ARF files is based
around the concept of an /entry/, a collection of data channels associated with
a particular point in time. An entry might contain one or more of the following:

+ raw extracellular neural signals recorded from a multichannel probe
+ spike times extracted from neural data
+ acoustic signals from a microphone
+ times when an animal interacted with a behavioral apparatus
+ the times when a real-time signal analyzer detected vocalization

Entries and datasets have metadata attributes describing how the data were
collected. Datasets and entries retain these attributes when copied or moved
between arf files, helping to prevent data from becoming orphaned and
uninterpretable.

This repository contains:

+ The specification for arf (see file:specification.org)
+ A fast, type-safe C++ interface for reading and writing arf files
+ A python interface for reading and writing arf files (based on h5py).
+ A very rudimentary MATLAB interface

** version information

The specification and implementations provided in this project use semantic
versioning (http://semver.org). The implementation versions are sychronized with
the major and minor version of the specification. For example, any python =arf=
package with version =2.0.x= is an implementation of the =2.0= ARF
specification. Any =2.x= implementation must be able to read and write any
=2.x= file.

The specification and implemenations are currently in release status for version
=2.0.0=. There was never a public release of previous versions. Some additional tasks
remain:

+ Auto-generate documentation from docstrings in c++ and python code
+ Update MATLAB interface to 2.0 spec.

** contributing

ARF is under active development and we welcome comments and contributions from
neuroscientists and behavioral biologist interested in using it. We're
particularly interested in use cases that don't fit the current specification.
Please post issues or contact Dan Meliza (dan at meliza.org) directly.

** installation

ARF files require HDF5>=1.8 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5).

The python interface requires Python>=2.6 and h5py>=2.0
(http://code.google.com/p/h5py/). To install the module:

: python setup.py install

To use the C++ interface, you need boost>=1.42 (http://boost.org). In addition,
if writing multithreaded code, HDF5 needs to be compiled with
=--enable-threadsafe=. The interface is header-only and does not need to be
compiled. To install:

: make install

To install the MATLAB interface, add the matlab subdirectory to MATLAB's search
path.

** accessing ARF files with HDF5 tools

This section describes how to inspect ARF files using standard tools, in the
event that the interfaces described here cease to function.

The structure of an ARF file can be explored using the =h5ls= tool. For example,
to list entries:

: $ h5ls file.arf

: test_0001                Group
: test_0002                Group
: test_0003                Group
: test_0004                Group

Each entry appears as a Group. To list the contents of an entry, use path
notation:

: $ h5ls file.arf/test_0001

: pcm                      Dataset {609914}

This shows that the data in =test_0001= is stored in a single node, =pcm}, with
609914 data points. Typically each channel will have its own dataset.

The =h5dump= command can be used to output data in binary format. See the HDF5
documentation for details on how to structure the output. For example, to
extract sampled data to a 16-bit little-endian file (i.e., PCM format):

: $ h5dump -d /test_0001/pcm -b LE -o test_0001.pcm file.arf
