Description: ================================
        Hindsight Software Python Client
        ================================
        
        This client provides access to Behave for Jira in a Python environment. It uses a HTTP GET call to
        download a compressed stream containing the feature files for the specified project, and then unzips
        the features into the specified directory.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        If using pip, simply::
        
            pip install hindsight
        
        If installing manually, grab the tarball below and extract to a temporary directory. Make sure the
        `requests <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests>`_ package is installed and available, and then run::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        from inside the temporary directory
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Within a script::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from hindsight.behave import JiraConnector
        
            b4j = JiraConnector()
            b4j.fetch(
                host='http://localhost:2990/jira',
                username='behaver',
                password='atdd4me',
                key='PROJ',
                dir='features',
                manual=True,
                verify=False
            )
        
        This take mandatory arguments host and key, and the rest are optional.
        
        Or the same request from the command line (if you installed via pip)::
        
            behave-cli -u behaver -p atdd4me -d features -m http://localhost:2990/jira PROJ
        
        Taking the form::
        
            behave-cli [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [-d DIR] [-m] [--verify] HOST KEY
        
        Field descriptions::
        
            host:      the host URL to the Jira installation running Behave for Jira
            username:  username of user with Behave rights on desired project
            password:  password for this user
            key:       project key to download features for
            dir:       directory relative to the script to download features to
                       (can also use absolute path)
            manual:    flag to include scenarios tagged with manual in the download
            verify:    flag to indicate whether to verify the SSL certificate if connecting over SSL
