Description: batou
        =====
        
        batou is a multi-(component|host|environment|...) deployment utility.
        
        Deployments are described in a model using "components" and can be deployed
        locally and remotely. Models are written as Python code.
        
        See the `batou documentation <http://batou.readthedocs.org>`_ for details
        on how to use it.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2 (2013-04-18)
        ================
        
        - Lots of stuff that went on unreleased for way too long. Producing a release
          to allow people to stop running from trunk.
        
        - Buildout component: Allow custom buildout.cfg names and pass the name to
          bootstrap.
        
        - Improve SSH connection error logging: more readable now and hosts are
          identifiable. (#12093)
        
        - Do not automatically add missing SSH host keys any longer. (#11606)
        
        - Use python version specific virtualenv, if availble. This helps with ancient
          Python 2.4 components. For specific virtualenv versions no explicit python
          executable is passed.
        
        - Internalize download hash handling using hashlib. Allow selection of hash
          function. (Thanks to Christine Koppelt.)
        
        - Introduce new component modelling approach.
        
        - Start writing documentation.
        
        - Improve error message when download fails due to checksum mismatch.
