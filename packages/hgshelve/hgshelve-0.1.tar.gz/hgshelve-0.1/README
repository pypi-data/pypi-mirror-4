The shelve extension provides the shelve command to let you choose which parts
of the changes in a working directory you'd like to set aside temporarily, at
the granularity of patch hunks. You can later restore the shelved patch hunks
using the unshelve command.

The shelve extension has been adapted from Mercurial's RecordExtension.

See `hg shelve --help` for the complete list of commands.
