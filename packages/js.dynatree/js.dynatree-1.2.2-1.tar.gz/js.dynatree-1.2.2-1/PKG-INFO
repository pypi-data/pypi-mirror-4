Description: js.dynatree
        ===========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This library packages `jquery.dynatree.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`jquery.dynatree.js`: https://code.google.com/p/dynatree/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.dynatree``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        You can import ``dynatree`` from ``js.dynatree`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.dynatree import dynatree
          >>> dynatree.need()
        
        You can also import the default skin::
        
          >>> from js.dynatree import dynatree_skin
          >>> dynatree_skin.need()
        
        ...or the vista skin::
        
          >>> from js.dynatree import dynatree_skin_vista
          >>> dynatree_skin_vista.need()
