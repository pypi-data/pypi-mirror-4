Storages

Using with a custom storage
===========================

Pipeline uses `Django Storage <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#storages>`_
to read, save and delete files, by default it use an improved ``StaticFilesStorage``.

You can provide your own via ``PIPELINE_STORAGE`` : ::

  PIPELINE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage'


Using with staticfiles
======================

Pipeline is providing a storage for `staticfiles app <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/>`_,
to use it configure ``STATICFILES_STORAGE`` like so ::

  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'pipeline.storage.PipelineStorage'

And if you want versioning use ::

  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'pipeline.storage.PipelineCachedStorage'

There is also non-packing storage available, that allows you to run ``collectstatic`` command
without packaging your assets. Useful for production when you don't want to run compressor or compilers ::

  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'pipeline.storage.NonPackagingPipelineStorage'

Also available if you want versioning ::

  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'pipeline.storage.NonPackagingPipelineCachedStorage'

Pipeline is also providing a storage that play nicely with staticfiles app
particularly for development : ::

  PIPELINE_STORAGE = 'pipeline.storage.PipelineFinderStorage'


Using with other storages
=========================

You can also use your own custom storage, for example, if you want to use S3 for your assets : ::

  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'your.app.S3PipelineStorage'

Your storage only need to inherit from ``PipelineMixin`` and/or ``CachedFilesMixin`` : ::

  from staticfiles.storage import CachedFilesMixin

  from pipeline.storage import PipelineMixin

  from storages.backends.s3boto import S3BotoStorage


  class S3PipelineStorage(PipelineMixin, CachedFilesMixin, S3BotoStorage):
       pass
