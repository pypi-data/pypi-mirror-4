Changes
=======

3.6.1 (2013-05-02)
------------------

- Fixed exception raising on unpickling errors when checking in.

- Improved reporting of unpickling errors.


3.6.0 (2012-03-15)
------------------

- Commit task will collect errors and send them all back rather
  than stopping on the first error encountered.


3.5.2 (2010-10-18)
------------------

- Fix tests; zope.location no longer exports TLocation.

- Raise the right error in zope.fssync.synchronizer when the configured
  synchronizer does not exist.

- Update dependency information.

- Minor code cleanups.


3.5.1 (2009-07-24)
------------------

- Properly setup tests, so that they will work in a release as well.

- Removed slugs.

3.5 (????)
----------

- Added the support for empty directories in snarf format. Now
  directories can be explicitly described by snarf.

- Synchronizers can now return callbacks from the load
  method. This allows for fix ups to be run later. This is useful
  when adding multiple objects at the same time that depend on
  each other. Callbacks can in turn return callbacks.

- Add support to FSMerger to allow locally modified files to be
  overwritten by files returned from the server. The purpose of
  this is to avoid conflicts after commit on files that are
  formatted differently on the server from local versions.

3.4.0b1 (????)
--------------

Refactoring of zope.fssync and zope.app.fssync into two clearly
separated packages:

- zope.fssync contains now a Python API that has no critical dependencies
  on Zope, the ZODB, and the security machinery.

- zope.app.fssync contains a protected web-based API and special
  synchronizers for zope.app content types.

Other major changes are

- synchronizers (i.e. serialization/de-serialization adapters) are created
  by named utilities which use dotted class names as lookup keys

- added doctests

- support for large files

- adapters for pickler, unpickler and handling of persistent pickle ids

- binaries are no longer merged

- case-insensitive filesystems and repositories use disambiguated names on
  export and the original names on import

- export and import of directly provided interfaces

- direct export to archives/direct import from archives

- addressed encoding problems on Mac OSX
