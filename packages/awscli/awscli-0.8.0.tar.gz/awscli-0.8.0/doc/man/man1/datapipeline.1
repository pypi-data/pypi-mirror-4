.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This is the \fIAWS Data Pipeline API Reference\fP . This guide provides descriptions
and samples of the AWS Data Pipeline API.
.sp
AWS Data Pipeline is a web service that configures and manages a data\-driven
workflow called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling
and ensuring that data dependencies are met so your application can focus on
processing the data.
.sp
The AWS Data Pipeline API implements two main sets of functionality. The first
set of actions configure the pipeline in the web service. You call these actions
to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the
transforms to be performed on the data.
.sp
The second set of actions are used by a task runner application that calls the
AWS Data Pipeline API to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic
for performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or
converting the data from one format to another, is contained within the task
runner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,
reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is done, the
task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.
.sp
AWS Data Pipeline provides an open\-source implementation of a task runner called
AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for
common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and
running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use
AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own
task runner to provide custom data management.
.sp
The AWS Data Pipeline API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing
requests. For information about how to sign a request with this protocol, go to
\fI\%Signature Version 4 Signing Process\fP
. In the code examples in this reference, the Signature Version 4 Request
parameters are represented as AuthParams.
