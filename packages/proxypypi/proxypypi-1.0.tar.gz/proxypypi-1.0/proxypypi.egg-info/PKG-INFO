Description: Caching PyPI Proxy
        ==================
        
        Use proxypypi to set up a caching proxy to PyPI (https://pypy.python.org/) to:
        
        1. make your installs reslilient against Internet/PyPI issues,
        2. speed up your installs significantly (after the first one),
        3. prevent problems installing packages that are removed from distribution by
           the author,
        4. allow installation of packages from within a firewalled environment where
           the host performing the installation does not have Internet access, and
        5. allow hosting and installation of private packages.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Setup of proxypypi requires:
        
        1. "pip install proxypypi"
        2. cd to some directory you would like files to be cached in
        3. proxypypi run
        
        There are some command-line arguments (see "proxypypi -h") that allow some
        run-time behaviour control. Notably "-d" which can configure the directory
        to cache in.
        
        Additionally the proxy may run in the background, in which case you need to
        supply three additional command-line arguments: "-P" (PID file), "-l" (log
        file) and "-o" (console output file) and use one of the daemon control commands
        instead of "run". See "proxypypi -h" for the commands.
        
        Once running you may perform pip installs using the proxy by including the
        proxy in the pip command line using the "-i" argument:
        
           pip install -i http://proxy_host:proxy_port/simple/ package_to_install
        
        Any packages not cached will be fetched into the cache and the install will
        continue as normal.
