Description: mrwolfe - "I'm Mr. Wolfe. I solve problems"
        ===========================================
        
        Mr.Wolfe is an issue tracker for support issues. This is not the same
        as a system for sofwtare issues, like Bugzilla, Jira, etc. In the
        latter issues are related to software, and are tracked in terms of a
        lifecylce from incoming to resolving in a specific software release
        (or closing without a release). Mr.Wolfe on the other hand tracks
        support issues, that may be questions, performance problems, software
        failures, etc.  An issue in Mr.Wolfe may or may not result in a
        software issue.
        
        Issues in Mr.Wolfe are related to a Service Level Agreement, and are
        handled according to the services agreed in the SLA. Several services
        may be added to a SLA.
        
        See the docs directory in the package for further reading.
