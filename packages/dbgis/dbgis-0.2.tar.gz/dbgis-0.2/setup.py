'python-dbgis is an extension to Psycopg_ and pyspatialite_, respectively a
PostgreSQL_ and SQLite_ database adapter for the Python_ programming language.
python-dbgis support geometry objects used by PostGIS_ and SpatiaLite_ by
translating between their EWKB representation and Python objects.

python-dbgis has been tested with Python 2.7.

python-dbgis is based on PPyGIS_ written by Bartosz Fabianowski
(bartosz@fabianowski.eu). Modifications_ written by Nicolas Ã‰vrard
(nicoe@b2ck.com) for Bio Eco Forests.
