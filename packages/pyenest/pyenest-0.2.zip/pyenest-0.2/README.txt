 Usage:
    'nest.py' can be imported and used programmatically, generally by passing
    parameters identifying specific structures and devices, meant for setups where
    you have multiples or want to be agnostic.

 Installation:
    pip install pyenest will do you right.

 Acknowledgements:
    Chris Burris's Siri Nest Proxy was very helpful to learn the nest's
       authentication and some bits of the protocol.
    Scott Baker's nest.py, which I (Eugene Efremov) shamelessly bastardized, was irreplaceable
       and without it I likely wouldn't have done any of this.
