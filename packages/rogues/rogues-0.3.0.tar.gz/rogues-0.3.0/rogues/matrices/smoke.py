    smoke     smoke matrix - complex, with a `smoke ring' pseudospectrum.
          smoke(n) is an n-by-n matrix with 1s on the
          superdiagonal, 1 in the (n,1) position, and powers of
          roots of unity along the diagonal.
          smoke(n, 1) is the same except for a zero (n,1) element.
          the eigenvalues of smoke(n, 1) are the n'th roots of unity;
          those of smoke(n) are the n'th roots of unity times 2^(1/n).

          Try ps(smoke(32)).  For smoke(n, 1) the pseudospectrum looks
          like a sausage folded back on itself.
          gersh(smoke(n, 1)) is interesting.
