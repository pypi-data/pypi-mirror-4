Description: =========
        QuickView
        =========
        
        QuickView is sort of a class based view on steriods, which handles basic scaffolding and basic views
        in very few lines of code. Take a look at quickview/__init__.py to look at what to override. The main job
        is creating necessary templates.
        
        NB! This is a proof-of-concept-release and has ONLY been tested under Python 3.3 and Django 1.5b2.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        0. pip install django-quickview.
        
        1. Add "quickview" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
              INSTALLED_APPS = (
                  ...
                  'quickview',
              )
        
        2. In your views.py do:
        
              import quickview
        
              class YourView(quickview.QuickView);
                  model = YourModel # points to a model in models.py
        
        3. In your project urls.py do something like this::
        
              from views import YourView
              urlpattern += YourView.get_urls()
        
        3. Run `python manage.py syncdb` to create any models.
        
        4. You'll have to create some templates and put these under yourapp/templates/yourapp/yourmodel or directly in your default templatefolder. The templates are:
        
            - index.html : lists all your models.
            - detail.html : detail view of one specific instance.
            - add.html : template to add instances.
            - update.html : template to update instances.
            - delete.html : template to delete an instance.
        
        5. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/yourapp/yourmodel/list/.
