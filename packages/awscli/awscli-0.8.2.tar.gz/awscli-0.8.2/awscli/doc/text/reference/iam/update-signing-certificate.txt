update-signing-certificate
**************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Changes the status of the specified signing certificate from active to
disabled, or vice versa. This action can be used to disable a user's
signing certificate as part of a certificate rotation work flow.

If the "--user-name" field is not specified, the --user-name is
determined implicitly based on the AWS Access Key ID used to sign the
request. Because this action works for access keys under the AWS
account, this API can be used to manage root credentials even if the
AWS account has no associated users.

For information about rotating certificates, see Managing Keys and
Certificates in *Using AWS Identity and Access Management* .
