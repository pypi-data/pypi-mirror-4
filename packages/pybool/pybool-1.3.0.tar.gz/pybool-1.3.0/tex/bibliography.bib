  abstract = {Liang, Fuhrman and Somogyi (PSB98, 18-29, 1998) have described an
	algorithm for inferring genetic network architectures from state
	transition tables which correspond to time series of gene expression
	patterns, using the Boolean network model. Their results of computational
	experiments suggested that a small number of state transition (INPUT/OUTPUT)
	pairs are sufficient in order to infer the original Boolean network
	correctly. This paper gives a mathematical proof for their observation.
	Precisely, this paper devises a much simpler algorithm for the same
	problem and proves that, if the indegree of each node (i.e., the
	number of input nodes to each node) is bounded by a constant, only
	O(log n) state transition pairs (from 2n pairs) are necessary and
	sufficient to identify the original Boolean network of n nodes correctly
	with high probability. We made computational experiments in order
	to expose the constant factor involved in O(log n) notation. The
	computational results show that the Boolean network of size 100,000
	can be identified by our algorithm from about 100 INPUT/OUTPUT pairs
	if the maximum indegree is bounded by 2. It is also a merit of our
	algorithm that the algorithm is conceptually so simple that it is
	extensible for more realistic network models.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Modern life sciences research increasingly relies on computational
	solutions, from large scale data analyses to theoretical modeling.
	Within the theoretical models Boolean networks occupy an increasing
	role as they are eminently suited at mapping biological observations
	and hypotheses into a mathematical formalism. The conceptual underpinnings
	of Boolean modeling are very accessible even without a background
	in quantitative sciences, yet it allows life scientists to describe
	and explore a wide range of surprisingly complex phenomena. In this
	paper we provide a clear overview of the concepts used in Boolean
	simulations, present a software library that can perform these simulations
	based on simple text inputs and give three case studies. The large
	scale simulations in these case studies demonstrate the Boolean paradigms
	and their applicability as well as the advanced features and complex
	use cases that our software package allows. Our software is distributed
	via a liberal Open Source license and is freely accessible from http://booleannet.googlecode.com.},

  abstract = {The cerebral cortex is divided into many functionally distinct areas.
	The emergence of these areas during neural development is dependent
	on the expression patterns of several genes. Along the anterior-posterior
	axis, gradients of Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8 play a particularly
	strong role in specifying areal identity. However, our understanding
	of the regulatory interactions between these genes that lead to their
	confinement to particular spatial patterns is currently qualitative
	and incomplete. We therefore used a computational model of the interactions
	between these five genes to determine which interactions, and combinations
	of interactions, occur in networks that reproduce the anterior-posterior
	expression patterns observed experimentally. The model treats expression
	levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the expression
	data currently available. We simulated gene expression patterns created
	by all possible networks containing the five genes of interest. We
	found that only of these networks were able to reproduce the experimentally
	observed expression patterns. These networks all lacked certain interactions
	and combinations of interactions including auto-regulation and inductive
	loops. Many higher order combinations of interactions also never
	appeared in networks that satisfied our criteria for good performance.
	While there was remarkable diversity in the structure of the networks
	that perform well, an analysis of the probability of each interaction
	gave an indication of which interactions are most likely to be present
	in the gene network regulating cortical area development. We found
	that in general, repressive interactions are much more likely than
	inductive ones, but that mutually repressive loops are not critical
	for correct network functioning. Overall, our model illuminates the
	design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development,
	and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.},

	strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional network analysis,
	i.e. for characterising functional states, for detecting functional
	dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies, or for giving
	qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations. CellNetAnalyzer
	extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally developed for metabolic
	network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling framework for examining
	signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods implemented in CellNetAnalyzer
	are discussed in more detail regarding algorithmic issues and applications:
	the computation and analysis (i) of shortest positive and shortest
	negative paths and circuits in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal
	intervention sets in logical networks.CellNetAnalyzer provides a
	single suite to perform structural and qualitative analysis of both
	mass-flow- and signal-flow-based cellular networks in a user-friendly
	environment. It provides a large toolbox with various, partially
	unique, functions and algorithms for functional network analysis.

	(PBN) that share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks,
	but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics
	of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of
	Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases.
	Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks--a
	family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic
	relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies
	between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building
	blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally,
	we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other
	genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above
