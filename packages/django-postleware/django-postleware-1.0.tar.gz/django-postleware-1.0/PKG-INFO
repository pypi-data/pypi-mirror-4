Description: # django-postleware
        
        A simple django middleware class which injects a `Cache-Control: no-cache`
        header onto POST responses.
        
        # Why?
        
        Mobile Webkit (iOS4+ and Android stock bowser) has a bug that causes it to 
        cache similar POST requests when it clearly shouldn't. Rather than only caching
        requests that have a specific `Cache-Control` header, it does the opposite and
        caches the request unless the `no-cache` value is present in the POST response.
        
        # Not working for you?
        
        Let me know by opening an issue or pull request. This was enough for me, but I
        have read around the webs that other devs needed to add additional headers to
        the response before it would stop caching.
