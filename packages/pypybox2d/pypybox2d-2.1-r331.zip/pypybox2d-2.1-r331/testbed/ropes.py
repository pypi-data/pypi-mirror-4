# This test shows how a rope joint can be used to stabilize a chain of
# bodies with a heavy payload. Notice that the rope joint just prevents
# excessive stretching and has no other effect.
# By disabling the rope joint you can see that the Box2D solver has trouble
# supporting heavy bodies with light bodies. Try playing around with the
# densities, time step, and iterations to see how they affect stability.
# This test also shows how to use contact filtering. Filtering is configured
# so that the payload does not collide with the chain."
