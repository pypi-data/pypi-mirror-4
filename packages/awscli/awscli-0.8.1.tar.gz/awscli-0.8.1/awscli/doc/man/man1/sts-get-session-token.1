.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The get\-session\-token action returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS
account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an Access Key ID, a Secret
Access Key, and a security token. These credentials are valid for the specified
duration only. The session duration for IAM users can be between 15 minutes and
36 hours, with a default of 12 hours. The session duration for AWS account
owners is restricted to a maximum of one hour. Providing the AWS Multi\-Factor
Authentication (MFA) device serial number and the token code is optional.
.sp
For more information about using get\-session\-token to create temporary
credentials, go to \fI\%Creating Temporary Credentials to Enable Access for IAM
Users\fP in \fIUsing IAM\fP .

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-duration\-seconds\fP  (integer)
The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid. Acceptable
durations for IAM user sessions range from 900s (15 minutes) to 129600s (36
hours), with 43200s (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for AWS account owners
are restricted to a maximum of 3600s (one hour). If the duration is longer
than one hour, the session for AWS account owners defaults to one hour.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-serial\-number\fP  (string)
The identification number of the MFA device for the user. If the IAM user has
a policy requiring MFA authentication (or is in a group requiring MFA
authentication) to access resources, provide the device value here.
.sp
The value is in the \fBSecurity Credentials\fP tab of the user\(aqs details pane in
the IAM console. If the IAM user has an active MFA device, the details pane
displays a \fBMulti\-Factor Authentication Device\fP value. The value is either
for a virtual device, such as \fBarn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user\fP , or it
is the device serial number for a hardware device (usually the number from the
back of the device), such as \fBGAHT12345678\fP . For more information, see
\fI\%Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Devices with AWS\fP in \fIUsing IAM\fP .
.TP
.B \fB\-\-token\-code\fP  (string)
The value provided by the MFA device. If the user has an access policy
requiring an MFA code (or is in a group requiring an MFA code), provide the
value here to get permission to resources as specified in the access policy.
If MFA authentication is required, and the user does not provide a code when
requesting a set of temporary security credentials, the user will receive an
"access denied" response when requesting resources that require MFA
authentication. For more information, see \fI\%Using Multi-Factor Authentication
(MFA) Devices with AWS\fP in \fIUsing IAM\fP .
