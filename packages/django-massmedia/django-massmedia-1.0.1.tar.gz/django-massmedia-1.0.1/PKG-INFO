        New in 0.8
        ==========
        
        * New settings format
        	All settings are contained within ``MASSMEDIA_SETTINGS``\ , ``MASSMEDIA_STORAGE``\ , and ``MASSMEDIA_UPLOAD_TO``\ . Old settings will work, but will raise a deprecation warning.
        
        * New settings
        	``MASSMEDIA_SETTINGS["USE_TAGGING"]`` and ``MASSMEDIA_SERVICES["YOUTUBE"]``
        
        * Support for YouTube feeds as collections
        
        Optional Requirements:
        	django-tagging
        
        Optional, but used for extracting Metadata:
        	IPTCInfo
        	hachoir-core
        	hachoir-metadata
        	hachoir-parser
        
        
        To start using the app, place it in your INSTALLED_APPS. You may want to edit the settings.py file in the massmedia directory and adjust a few things. If you want to gather metadata, you should install the hachoir lib available at http://hachoir.org/. All in all, you will need the hachoir core,parser, and metadata packages installed.
        
        To customize the app, try editing some of the templates. Media items are templated with the show_media tag using templates based on the media's mimetype.
