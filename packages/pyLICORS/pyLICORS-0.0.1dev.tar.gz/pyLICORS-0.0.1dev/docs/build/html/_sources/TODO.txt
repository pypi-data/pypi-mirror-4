Data formats etc
================

#. load data from URLs and not necessarily from local folders

#. save the resuls in a different (pre-specified) folder

#. allow specification of filename plus path, and do internally a split

Data handling, number crunching
===============================

#. if new light cones are completely in old light cones, dont make a new hdf5 file but project
   old hdf5 entries down to the new light cones.

#. pyLICORS should figure out the frames per chunk number automatically from the data / computer specification

Coding
