Description: cliTunes
        =========
        
        For now, this is just a command-line interface to iTunes. It's pretty
        simple, but I am considering making it do a lot of more interesting
        things as time goes by.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, simply use **pip** or **easy_install**:
        
            easy_install clitunes
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Put bin/clitunes somewhere in your path. Now, you can handle playback like
        this:
        
            clitunes play
            clitunes pause
            clitunes stop
        
        You can also navigate files like this:
        
            clitunes rewind
            clitunes fast forward
            clitunes resume
        
        or perform a lot of other useful actions:
        
            clitunes subscribe \"http://example.com/podcast.xml\"
        
        Running clitunes without any options will assume that you want to use the
        "playpause" command. This will play unless already playing, at which time
        it will pause instead.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        - Figure out how to be smarter about stringifying things. Passing strings to
          iTunes shouldn't require a user to escape every quote manually.
        
        
        
        0.0.2
        -----
        
        - Fixed error reporting
        - Added ability to perform multi word commands (next track, previous track)
        - Added shortcuts to some operations (ff=fast forward, rw=rewind, next=next
          track, prev=previous track, etc.)
        
        0.0.1
        -----
        
        - Initial version. Basic play/stop functionality.
