        About
        -----
        `clamd` is a portable Python module to use the ClamAV anti-virus engine on 
        Windows, Linux, MacOSX and other platforms. It requires a running instance of 
        the `clamd` daemon.
        
        This is a fork of pyClamd v0.2.0 created by Philippe Lagadec and published on his website: http://www.decalage.info/en/python/pyclamd which in turn is a slightly improved version of pyClamd v0.1.1 created by Alexandre Norman and published on his website: http://xael.org/norman/python/pyclamd/
