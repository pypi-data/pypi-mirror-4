What is gocept.linkchecker?
===========================

gocept.linkchecker is a Plone productÂ which both monitors the availability of
links (URLs) within the *content* of the site and shows which objects are
referencing each other.

High level overview
  A coloured and grouped list of all links of the site gives a detailed and
  high level overview on the status of the links.

Author and object level overview
  Additional reporting is available to the content authors who can see their
  personal link status page (My links) as well as an overview over all links in
  one object (Links tab of object).

Referenced by
  A portlet shows whether an object is referenced by another object (due to
  HTML anchor or img tag).

Replace functionality
  Directly edit URLs of (broken) links from the overview without having to locate the
  link deep in a document.

How to install or upgrade
=========================

Use the general Plone installation mechanism that you're familiar with
(Control Panel or Generic Setup).
