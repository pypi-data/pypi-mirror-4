Description: Description
        _______________________________________________________________________________
        
        'pyabm' is an agent-based modeling toolkit written to simplify coding and 
        running agent-based models int he Python programming language. pyabm 
        includes tools to output model results (as text files, plots or ESRI 
        shapefiles), and has a parameter handling system to ease the process of 
        model testing and validation, and of running multiple scenarios with 
        varying model parameters.
        
        The model was constructed by Alex Zvoleff as part of his dissertation 
        research at San Diego State University (SDSU) in the Department of 
        Geography. Contact Alex Zvoleff or Prof. Li An at SDSU with any questions.
