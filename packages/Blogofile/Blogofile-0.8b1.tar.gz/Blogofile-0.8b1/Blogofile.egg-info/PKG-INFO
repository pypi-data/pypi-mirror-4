Description: Blogofile is a static website compiler that lets you use various template
        libraries (Mako, Jinja2),
        and various markup languages (reStructuredText, Markdown, Textile)
        to create sites that can be served from any web server you like.
        
        Version 0.8 of Blogofile breaks out the core static site compiler
        and gives it a plugin interface.
        That allows features like the blog engine that was Blogofile's
        original raison d`Ãªtre to be built on top of the core.
        
        `blogofile_blog`_ is a blog engine plugin created by the Blogofile developers.
        With it installed you get a simple blog engine that requires no
        database and no special hosting environment.
        You customize a set of Mako templates,
        create posts in reStructuredText, Markdown, or Textile, (or even plain HTML)
        and blogofile generates your entire blog as
        plain HTML, CSS, images, and Atom/RSS feeds
        which you can then upload to any old web server you like.
        No CGI or scripting environment is needed on the server.
        
        See the `Blogofile website`_ for an example of a Blogofile-generated
        site that includes a blog,
        and check out the `project docs`_ for a quick-start guide,
        and detailed usage instructions.
        
        Or, if you're the "just get it done sort",
        create a virtualenv,
        and dive in with::
        
          pip install -U Blogofile
          pip install -U blogofile_blog

        Features
        --------
        
        - The documentation source files have been moved into the project
          repository.
          They are built and rendered at http://docs.blogofile.com/ thanks to
          the readthedocs.org service.
        
        - The init sub-command syntax and functionality has changed; see
          ``blogofile help init``.
        
        - The configuration system has been refactored.
          The default configuration settings are now in the ``default_config.py``
          module.
        
        - As a result of the refactoring of the initialization function,
          and the configuration system,
          the ``site_init`` directory has been eliminated.
        
        - Improved Unicode handling in slugs.
          See https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/issues/124
        
        - The codebase has been unified for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2
          (no 2to3 or 3to2 conversion required).
        
        - The command line completion feature has been removed so as to avoid
          maintaining a bundled version of the ``argparse`` library.
          ``argparse`` is included in the standard library for Python 2.7 and
          3.2+.
          ``setup.py`` will install it from PyPI for Python 2.6.
