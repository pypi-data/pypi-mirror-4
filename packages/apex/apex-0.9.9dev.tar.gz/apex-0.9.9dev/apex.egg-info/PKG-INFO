        * Authentication
        
        Authentication has a single authentication id which can have multiple
        associated credentials. A user can create a username and associate their
        Facebook and Google login records with their current record and log in
        with any of them. It is planned that Apex will act as an endpoint for
        multi-domain multi-site installations - allowing one to associate a login
        account from one domain to another.
        
        Local authentication uses salt + BCrypt

        Ability to overload the login form, extend the AuthUser class through
        polymorphism or a Foreign Key user profile table.
        
        * Form Library
        
        WTForms is used to help those transitioning over from Django to Pyramid.
        
        * I18N/L10N
        
        Babel is used to support Internationalization and Localization.
        
        * Flash Messages
        
        Templates and helpers for Mako and Jinja2 are included to support Flash
        Messages in your application.
        
        
        * apexid_from_token renamed to apex_id_from_token
        * added 'add_auth' function to allow secondary authentication providers
          on a single auth_id
