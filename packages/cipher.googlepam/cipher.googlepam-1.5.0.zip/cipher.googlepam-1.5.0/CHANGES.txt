CHANGES
=======

1.5.0 (2012-10-09)
------------------

- Support multiple Google groups.  The authenticating user has to be a member
  of any one of them for access to be allowed.

- Added add-google-users new option --exclude to skip adding some users
  (e.g. the 'admin' user might clash with an existing 'admin' group, causing
  the script to fail).

- Added add-google-users option --add-to-group as a more meaningful alias for
  the old --admin-group option.

- Added add-google-users option --add-to-group-command for completeness.


1.4.0 (2012-10-08)
------------------

- Set umask to avoid world-readable log and cache files.

- Add a space after the PAM prompt.

- The add-google-users script now reads the pam_google config file to get the
  domain, username, password and group.  You can also use -C/--config-file to
  specify a different config file.

- add-google-users does not break if you don't specify --admin-group.

- Added Debian packaging.


1.3.0 (2012-04-24)
------------------

- Added ability to cache authentication result, since some uses, such as
  Apache authentication can cause a lot of requests. File- and
  memcached-based caches have been implemented and are available/configurable
  in the configuration file.

- Fully stubbed out the Google API for faster and simpler testing.

- Removed all traces of Cipher's specific account details.

- Changed all headers to ZPL.

- The package is ready for public release.


1.2.0 (2012-04-17)
------------------

- Do not fail if the username already exists.


1.1.0 (2012-04-17)
------------------

- Make the admin group configurable.


1.0.0 (2012-04-17)
------------------

- PAM module authenticating against users in a group of a particular Google
  domain.

- Script to add all users of a group within a Google domain as system users.
