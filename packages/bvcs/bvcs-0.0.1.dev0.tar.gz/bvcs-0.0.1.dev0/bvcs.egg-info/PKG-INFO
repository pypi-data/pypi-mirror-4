Description: 
        Batched VCS commands
        ====================
        
        Run bunch of VCS commands (git/hg/bzr) over a set of repositories.
        
        Use cases:
        
        * You want to make sure you pushed changes to remote for all of your
          repositories.
        * You want to log the revision of all of your repositories.
        * You are using git but want to have hg/bzr repositories as submodule.
        * You want to do (equivalent of) ``git fetch`` for all of your repositories.
        * etc...
