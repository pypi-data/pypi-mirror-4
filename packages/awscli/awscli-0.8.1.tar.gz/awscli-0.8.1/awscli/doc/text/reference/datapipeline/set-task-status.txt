set-task-status
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Notifies AWS Data Pipeline that a task is completed and provides
information about the final status. The task runner calls this action
regardless of whether the task was sucessful. The task runner does not
need to call  set-task-status for tasks that are canceled by the web
service during a call to report-task-progress .

========

   aws datapipeline set-task-status
     --task-id <value>
     --task-status <value>
