This module (authres) is designed to provide support for RFC 5451,
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5451,  processing in Python.

It also supports Authentication Results extensions:

RFC 5617 DKIM/ADSP
RFC 6008 DKIM signature identification (header.b)
RFC 6212 Vouch By Reference (VBR)

import authres only provides the RFC 5451 types. Individual additions can be
imported by name, import authres.dkim_b, authres.dkim_adsp, authres.vbr. To
use all the features, the feature context authres.all_features() is provided.

Header folding and unfolding is the responsibility of the calling application.

Between docstrings and RFC 5451 the API should be reasonably clear, but the
docstrings are still a work in progress.  Additional examples are available in
the file authres/tests.  The API is completely reworked from version 0.1.

This package requires python2.6 or later (including python3).

To execute doctests, run the module as main, python -m authres

This is completely untested on Windows, but in theory should work.
