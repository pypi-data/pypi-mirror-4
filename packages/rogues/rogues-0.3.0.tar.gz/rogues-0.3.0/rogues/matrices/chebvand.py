    CHEBVAND  Vandermonde-like matrix for the Chebyshev polynomials.
          c = chebvand(p), where P is a vector, produces the (primal)
          Chebyshev Vandermonde matrix based on the points P,
          i.e., c[i,j] = t_{i-1}(p[j]), where T_{i-1} is the Chebyshev
          polynomial of degree i-1.
          CHEBVAND(M,P) is a rectangular version of CHEBVAND(P) with M rows.
          Special case: If P is a scalar then P equally spaced points on
                        [0,1] are used.
