Description: ====================
        `backports.inspect`_
        ====================
        
        This is a backport of (some) `Python 3 inspect module`_ features to
        2.7 (piggybacking on `aliles/funcsigs`_).
        
        **NOTE:** While `aliles/funcsigs`_ targets Python 2.6 *and* 2.7,
          `backports.inspect` *only* targets 2.7.
        
        **NOTE:** This module monkeypatches `formatannotation` in
        `aliles/funcsigs`_ to fix a small bug. This will go away once `our
        pull request`_ is integrated.
        
        **BUGS:** There are currently no unit tests :-( ...which must mean
        there are no bugs! :-) We welcome issues to expose this assertion as
        incorrect, and pull requests to rectify that...

        which most (all?) of this library is derived, is in the public domain.
