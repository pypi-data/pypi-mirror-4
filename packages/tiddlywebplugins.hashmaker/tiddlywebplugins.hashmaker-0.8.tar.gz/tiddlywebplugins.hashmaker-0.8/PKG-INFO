Description: A TiddlyWeb plugin which adds a _hash field to outgoing tiddlers.
        
        * When a tiddler is get from the store, if there is no _hash, then the
          hash is added to the outgoing tiddler. It is _not_ saved
        
        This is done to allow quick comparisons between tiddlers which may have
        different names but may have the same set of content characteristics.
        
        The hash_tiddler method is exposed so that stores can create a hash
        prior to a put to the store. See tiddlywebplugis.tiddlyspace.store for
        an example.
        
        To use add 'tiddlywebplugins.hashmaker' to system_plugins and
        twanager_plugins in tiddlywebconfig.py. Optionally define 
        hashmaker.attributes to be a list of strings representing the attributes
        or fields of a tiddler which are to be hashed. The default is:
        
            ['text']
        
Platform: Posix; MacOS X; Windows
