create-snapshot
***************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Create a snapshot of the volume identified by volume ID. A volume does
not have to be detached at the time the snapshot is taken.

Note: Snapshot creation requires that the system is in a consistent state.
  For instance, this means that if taking a snapshot of a database,
  the tables must be read-only locked to ensure that the snapshot will
  not contain a corrupted version of the database. Therefore, be
  careful when using this API to ensure that the system remains in the
  consistent state until the create snapshot status has returned.
