put-metric-alarm
****************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified
Amazon CloudWatch metric. Optionally, this operation can associate one
or more Amazon Simple Notification Service resources with the alarm.

When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately
set to "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" . The alarm is evaluated and its
"StateValue" is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the
"StateValue" is then executed.

Note: When updating an existing alarm, its "StateValue" is left unchanged.

REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--evaluation-periods"  (integer)
   The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified
   threshold.

"--namespace"  (string)
   The namespace for the alarm's associated metric.

"--period"  (integer)
   The period in seconds over which the specified statistic is
   applied.

"--comparison-operator"  (string)
   The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified "--
   statistic" and "--threshold" . The specified "--statistic" value is
   used as the first operand.

"--alarm-name"  (string)
   The descriptive name for the alarm. This name must be unique within
   the user's AWS account

"--statistic"  (string)
   The statistic to apply to the alarm's associated metric.

"--threshold"  (double)
   The value against which the specified statistic is compared.

"--metric-name"  (string)
   The name for the alarm's associated metric.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--dimensions"  (list)
   The dimensions for the alarm's associated metric.

      (structure)
         The "Dimension" data type further expands on the identity of
         a metric using a Name, Value pair.

         "name"  (string)
            The name of the dimension.

         "value"  (string)
            The value representing the dimension measurement

        {
          "name": "string",
          "value": "string"
        }
        ...
      ]

"--alarm-actions"  (list of string)
   The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an
   "ALARM" state from any other state. Each action is specified as an
   Amazon Resource Number (ARN). Currently the only action supported
   is publishing to an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon Auto Scaling
   policy.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--alarm-description"  (string)
   The description for the alarm.

"--unit"  (string)
   The unit for the alarm's associated metric.

"--insufficient-data-actions"  (list of string)
   The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an
   "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" state from any other state. Each action is
   specified as an Amazon Resource Number (ARN). Currently the only
   action supported is publishing to an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon
   Auto Scaling policy.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--ok-actions"  (list of string)
   The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an
   "OK" state from any other state. Each action is specified as an
   Amazon Resource Number (ARN). Currently the only action supported
   is publishing to an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon Auto Scaling
   policy.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      ["string", ...]

"--actions-enabled"  (boolean)
   Indicates whether or not actions should be executed during any
   changes to the alarm's state.
