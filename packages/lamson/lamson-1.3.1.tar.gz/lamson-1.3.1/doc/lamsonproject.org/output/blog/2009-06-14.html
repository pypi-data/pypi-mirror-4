                <h1>The Mailocalypse Is Upon Us!</h1>
                	<p>I&#8217;m currently polishing off the two final features before I start going for
the Lamson 1.0 release.  I&#8217;ve been using Lamson to make a few little cute applications
and create one thing for a potential client, and so far I haven&#8217;t had to change much
since 0.9.3.  It&#8217;s great so far and I hope that Lamson 1.0 will be a fun release.</p>

	<p>The <strong>big</strong> thing that must improve though is handling character encodings in emails.
After spending a week or more trying to come up with an automated conversion scheme that 
would honor all the encodings on the planet, I had a realization.</p>

	<h2>Why Isn&#8217;t All Mail UTF-8?</h2>

	<p>Remembering the purpose of Lamson as a <strong>modern</strong> mail server and framework, it finally
struck me as dumb that I&#8217;m trying to keep around encodings that were invented in the 
pre-Unicode days.  Every modern system understands and displays UTF-8, and apart from
some pissy attitudes from the Japanese about the Han unification, there&#8217;s really no reason
that every email Lamson handles can&#8217;t be &#8220;upgraded&#8221; to UTF-8.</p>

	<p>As I thought about this more I started to like the idea.  Take all mail Lamson handles, and
upgrade it to utf-8.  Then inside Lamson you know that it&#8217;s future proofed and ready to
be used by Python no matter what.  Finally when the mail goes out, the conversion for sending
is simply to encode the email as proper UTF-8 encoding consistently.</p>

	<p>However, I&#8217;m not the type of person to think any random idea I have is instantly valid because
I thought it up.  Before I make a grand announcement that Lamson only deals with UTF-8 I better
know that it&#8217;s going to have minimal impact on people using it.  I made a similar decision with
Mongrel, where I chose <strong>not</strong> to accept clients that didn&#8217;t follow the standard, and it turned
out to block a ton of security attacks for free.</p>

	<p>What if Lamson&#8217;s required conversion to UTF-8 could not only simplify Lamson mail processing,
but also prevent spam and security flaws?  I decided to do some basic analysis and find out.</p>

	<h2>This Is The Mailocalypse</h2>

	<p>I&#8217;ve decided that Lamson will <strong>NOT</strong> try to maintain the encodings it is given by a client.
It will consider all encodings suspect, and attempt to convert them to UTF-8 as a means
of cleaning and simplifying the mail it receives before it talks to other systems.  Every
other system you&#8217;d most likely talk to is either UTF-8 capable or even requires it.</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m calling this &#8220;The Mailocalypse&#8221; because it&#8217;s funny, but it will also separate Lamson from
other systems, in potentially awesome or horrible ways.</p>

	<p>To validate this premise, I created a small Python script that takes a Maildir or mbox and tries to 
convert every email into a UTF-8 encoding.  It&#8217;s not trying to write the emails, just
load them and convert every single piece reliably to UTF-8.  It then reports any emails
that have a problem with the conversion.  After that I ran it on a bunch of mail I had
and got other people to run it and report their findings.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p> <a href="/mailocalypse.py">You can grab the mailocalypse.py script here.</a>  Improvements welcome.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The data I got from a small sample of the mail (randomly selected) was the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
all bad spam
5069 7 0
263 15 1
1806 231 1
2650 69 0
4509 20 0
2023 495 1
3723 74 0
</pre>

	<blockquote>
		<p>all is the total number of messages in the mailbox (including bad).  bad is the number that were bad. 
spam is whether that box was a spam box or not (meaning all messages were classified as spam).</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>I also made sure that the characters showed up in web browsers and in various UTF-8 
mail clients and terminal windows.  Most of the conversion was reliable and very 
fast for a quick script.</p>

	<p>With the above data, there&#8217;s two things you can notice right away, and which are confirmed with a quick
R session:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Spam fails to convert more frequently than ham messages.  It looks like failure to convert is a 0.03 significant indicator that the message is spam.  I&#8217;d need more data to confirm that.</li>
		<li>Legit mail (ham) only has a 1.2% chance of failing to convert, and a quick eye-ball sample says those failures mail are mostly spam that wasn&#8217;t classified right.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Potential Problems</h2>

	<p>This analysis shows initially that converting mail to UTF-8 could work, but there are two problems
I see so far:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>I may not be doing the best conversion in that script.</li>
		<li>Encryption and signatures will screw this up.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>For the first problem I&#8217;m posting the script and asking people to check it out and
let me know if there&#8217;s problems.  Run it on your stuff and shoot me the ALL/<span class="caps">BAD</span> numbers
when it&#8217;s done.  Check the code and see if you can improve it.  Whatever you can to show
that converting to UTF-8 is a good <strong>OR</strong> bad idea.</p>

	<p>A key design decision though will be that you never lose the original email, only that it
is converted for Lamson so you can work with it in your code without it blowing up.  If the
mail can&#8217;t convert, then it&#8217;s bad email and should be rejected anyway.  No point trying to
process it.  For encrypted email or ones with signatures you would just run all the validation
on the original, or forward the original on, depending on your application.</p>

	<p>For example, a mailing list would still want to convert all mail to UTF-8 for
processing, posting to web sites, spam filtering, and rejecting potentially bad
email.  Signed and encrypted email would then just be forwarded on in original form,
or decoded and validated depending on the how the mailing list works.</p>

	<h2>Advice And Criticism Welcome</h2>

	<p>Take the mailocalypse script (presented below for review) and try it out.  Confirm that
it works on most of your mail, and send me the results.  Simplest way is to send me
a message on twitter like:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>@zedshaw <span class="caps">ALL</span> 2340 <span class="caps">BAD</span> 17 spam yes #mailocalypse</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>And I&#8217;ll tally the results and do a better analysis.</p>

	<p>You are also encouraged to fill me in on what I&#8217;m missing in the idea.  Realize that <strong>part</strong> 
of the idea is to eliminate uncommon corner cases and to prove that a situation is common
using evidence.  Try to follow the same model by running the script on your mail to prove
that it won&#8217;t convert reliably or devise your own script to demonstrate your thoughts.</p>
