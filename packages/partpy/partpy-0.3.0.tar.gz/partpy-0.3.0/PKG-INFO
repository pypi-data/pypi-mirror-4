Description: partpy
        ------
        
        Parser Tools in Python (``partpy``, pronounced ``Par-Tee-Pie``), a
        collection of tools for hand writing lexers and parsers in python.
        
        There are many parser generators but there isn't much help for those
        who wish to roll their own parser/lexer as counter-intuitive as that
        may sound. ``partpy`` provides a solid base for hand written parsers
        and lexers through a library of common tools.
        
        By using ``partpy`` as the base for your own parser or lexer the hope
        is to provide you with an environment where you can dive straight into
        the language design, recognition and whatever else you need to do
        without having to figure out how string matching should be done or
        most of the error handling process.
