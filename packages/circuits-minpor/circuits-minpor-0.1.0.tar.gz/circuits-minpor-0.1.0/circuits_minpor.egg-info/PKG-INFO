        Overview
        --------
        
        circuits-minpor provides a minimal portal component based on the
        the `circuits framework`_. Read the `Package Documentation`_
        for details.
        
        The source is maintained at `github`_. Please use the `issue tracker`_ 
        there to report any issues.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        circuits-minpor depends on the `Python Standard Library`_,
        the `circuits framework`_ in the upcoming 1.7 version,
        the general purpose `circuits_bricks` components and the
        `rbtranslations` library. Both circuits bricks and the
        resource bundle translations library are small libraries
        that have been developed in parallel with the portal
        component. They have been singled out because they have
        proven to be useful independent of this portal component. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The simplest and recommended way to install circuits-minpor is with 
        easy_install::
        
            > easy_install circuits-minpor
        
        Alternatively, you may download the source package from the
        `circuits-minpor Page on PyPI`_ or from `github`_, extract it 
        and install using::
        
            > python setup.py install
