Description: StructuRX interprets medication prescriptions into a structured format using
        dependency parses [1] or third-party drug NER pipeline [2].
        
        The dependency-parse version uses a hand-crafted set of rules as described in
        [1] based on the output of the `ClearParser dependency parser
        <https://code.google.com/p/clearparser>`_, while the alternative method
        described in [2] uses the output of the drug NER pipeline from the `cTAKES
        clinical NER system <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ohnlp/files/cTAKES/>`_.
        
        Created by Andrew MacKinlay from the `Biomedical Informatics team 
        <http://nicta.com.au/business/health/biomedical_informatics>`_ at `NICTA 
        <http://nicta.com.au>`_, and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
        
        Recommended installation method:
        
        ::
        
          $ pip install StructuRX
        
        But of course you can instead do an old-fashioned:
        
        ::
        
         $ python setup.py install
        
        from a `VCS checkout <https://bitbucket.org/nicta_biomed/structurx/src>`_ or 
        `tarball/zip download <https://bitbucket.org/nicta_biomed/structurx/downloads>`_.
        In the latter case you will need to ensure that `ClearWrap 
        <https://bitbucket.org/nicta_biomed/clearwrap>`_ is 
        installed, and in either case you will need a copy of the 
        `NICTA fork <https://bitbucket.org/nicta_biomed/clearparser_flex>`_
        of `ClearParser <https://code.google.com/p/clearparser>`_ available to do the
        dependency parsing. We highly recommend installing into a virtualenv.
        If you wish to test against cTAKES, that will naturally need to be installed as 
        well. 
        
        After installing, run the provided script ``structurx-run.py`` and follow
        the instructions for configuration.
