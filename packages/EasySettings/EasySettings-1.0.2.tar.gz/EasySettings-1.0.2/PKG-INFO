Description: Easy Settings
        =============
        
        Easy Settings allows you to easily save and retrieve simple application settings.
        
        Example
        =======
        Example of Easy Settings usage::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from easysettings import easysettings
        
            settings = easysettings.easysettings("myconfigfile.conf")
            settings.configfile_create()
            
            settings.set("username", "cjw")
            
            print settings.get("username")
            # this results in "cjw"
            settings.save()
            # you may also set & save in one line...
            settings.setsave("username", "otheruser")
        
        Features
        ========
        Easy Settings has the basic features you would expect out of a settings module,
        and it's very easy to use. If your project needs to save simple string settings without
        the overhead and complication of other modules then this is for you. 
        
        Easy Settings uses a dictionary to store settings before writing to disk, so you can
        also access settings like a dictionary object using ``easysettings.settings``. This 
        allows you to do things like this (where ``mysettings`` is an EasySettings instance)::
            for s_opt in mysettings.settings.iterkeys():
        	print "Setting '" + s_opt + "' is set to '" + mysettings.settings[s_opt] + "'"
            # this results in: "Setting 'username' is set to 'otheruser'"
        
        You can also retrieve a list of options & values strings::
            lst_settings = mysettings.list_settings()
            for itm in lst_settings:
        	print itm
            # this results in "username=otheruser"
