        ===============
        
        django-sendgrid is the easiest way to send e-mail with SendGrid. It uses the SendGrid SMTP API, as recommended.
        
        Although it's rather simple to use, a example project is included to demonstrate usage.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install with PyPi::
        
        	pip install django-sendgrid
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add ``sendgrid`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``::
        
        	INSTALLED_APPS = (
        		# Existing apps
        		"sendgrid",
        	)
        
        Add the following to your ``settings``::
        
        	SENDGRID_EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.sendgrid.net"
        	SENDGRID_EMAIL_PORT = 587
        	SENDGRID_EMAIL_USERNAME = "your_sendgrid_username"
        	SENDGRID_EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_sendgrid_password"
        
        The API is similar to that of Django's; create a ``SendGridEmailMessage`` and send it::
        	
        	>>> from sendgrid.message import SendGridEmailMessage
        	>>> email = SendGridEmailMessage('Subject', 'Body', 'ryan@ryanbalfanz.net', ['ryan@ryanbalfanz.net'])
        	>>> email.send()
