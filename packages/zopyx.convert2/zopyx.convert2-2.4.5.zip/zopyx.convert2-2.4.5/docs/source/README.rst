  This will install automatically the Beautifulsoup and Elementree modules if necessary.
- the environment variable *$XFC_DIR* must be set and point to the root of your XFC installation directory
- the environment variable *$XINC_HOME* must be set and to point to the root of your XINC installation directory
- the environment variable *$FOP_HOME* must be set and point to the root of your FOP installation directory
- the 'prince' binary must be in the $PATH if you are using PrinceXML

Usage
-----

Some examples from the Python command-line::

  from zopyx.convert2 import Converter
  C = Converter('/path/to/some/file.html')
  pdf_filename = C('pdf-xinc')['output_filename']       # using XINC
  pdf2_filename = C('pdf-pisa')['output_filename']      # using PISA
  pdf3_filename = C('pdf-fop')['output_filename']       # using FOP
  pdf4_filename = C('pdf-prince')['output_filename']    # using FOP
  rtf_filename = C('rtf-xfc')['output_filename']        
  pdt_filename = C('odt-xfc')['output_filename']
  wml_filename = C('wml-xfc')['output_filename']
  docx_filename = C('docx-xfc')['output_filename']

A very simple command-line converter is also available::

  html-convert --format rtf --output foo.rtf sample.html


`html-convert` has a --test option that will convert some
sample HTML. If everything is ok then you should see something like that::

  >html-convert --test
  Entering testmode
  pdf: /tmp/tmpuOb37m.html -> /tmp/tmpuOb37m.pdf
  rtf: /tmp/tmpuOb37m.html -> /tmp/tmpuOb37m.rtf
  docx: /tmp/tmpuOb37m.html -> /tmp/tmpuOb37m.docx
  odt: /tmp/tmpuOb37m.html -> /tmp/tmpuOb37m.odt
  wml: /tmp/tmpuOb37m.html -> /tmp/tmpuOb37m.wml
  pdf: /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.html -> /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.pdf
  rtf: /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.html -> /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.rtf
  docx: /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.html -> /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.docx
  odt: /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.html -> /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.odt
  wml: /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.html -> /tmp/tmpZ6PGo9.wml


How zopyx.convert2 works internally
-----------------------------------

- The source HTML file is converted to XHTML using mxTidy
- the XHTML file is converted to FO using the great "csstoxslfo" converter
  written by Werner Donne.
- the FO file is passed either to the external XINC or XFC converter to 
  generated the desired output format
- all converters are based on Java technology make the conversion solution
  highly portable across operating system (including Windows)

Environment variables
---------------------

The following environment variables can be used to resolve OS or distribution
specific problems:

``ZOPYX_CONVERT_SHELL`` - defaults to ``sh`` and is used to as shell command to
execute external converters

``ZOPYX_CONVERT_EXECUTION_MODE`` - default to ``process`` and refers to the
method of Python executing external command (by default using the ``process`` module.
Other value: ``system``, ``commands``


Known issues
------------

- If you are using zopyx.convert2 together with FOP: use the latest FOP 0.94
  only.  Don't use any packaged FOP version like the one from MacPorts which is
  known to be broken.    

- Ensure that you have read the ``csstoxslfo`` documentation. ``csstoxslfo`` has
  several requirements about the HTML markup. Don't expect that it is the ultimate
  HTML converter. Any questions regarding the necessary markup are documented in the 
  ``csstoxslfo`` documentation and will not be answered.
