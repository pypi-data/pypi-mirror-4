   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. include:: ../README.rst

There are two primary components to the metlog-py library, the :doc:`api/client`
client class which exposes the primary metlog client API, and the various
:doc:`api/senders` classes, one of which must be provided to the MetlogClient and
which handles the actual delivery of the message to the router component.

The MetlogClient can be instantiated directly, but metlog-py also provides some
utility functions that will parse config files and set up a configured client
instance for you. Folks new to using Metlog will probably find :doc:`config` a
good place to get started.
