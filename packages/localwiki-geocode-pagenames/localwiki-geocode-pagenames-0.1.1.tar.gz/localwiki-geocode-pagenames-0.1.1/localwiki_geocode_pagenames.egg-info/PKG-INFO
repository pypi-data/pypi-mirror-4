Description: Testing out a really rough, semi-automated pagename geocode thing using the
        LocalWiki API.
        
        The idea is that you'd run this against a LocalWiki instance and it will add
        maps to pages that don't have maps but have page names that look a lot like addresses.
        
        This is really only useful for LocalWikis that were birthed from a legacy wiki
        import or something where you've got lots of pages with addresses-for-pagenames
        but no maps.
        
        To install:
        
            $ pip install localwiki-geocode-pagenames
        
        To run:
        
            $ localwiki-geocode-pagenames
        
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        This was thrown together when migrating ArborWiki.org from their old wiki
        software.  They had a lot of pagenames like "34 South Parkside" but the pages
        themselves lacked maps.
