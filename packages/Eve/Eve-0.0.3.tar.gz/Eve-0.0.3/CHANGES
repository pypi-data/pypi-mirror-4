Eve Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Eve release.

Version 0.0.3
-------------

Not yet released.

- XML rendering love. Lots of love.

- JSON links are always wrapped in a ``_links`` dictionary. Key values match
  the relation between the item being represented and the linked resource.

- Streamlined JSON responses.  
  
  Superflous ``response`` root key has been removed from JSON payloads. 

  GET requests to resource endpoints: items are now wrapped with an ``_items``
  list. 
  
  GET requests to item endpoints: item is now at root level, with no wrappers
  around it. 

- Support for API versioning through the new API_VERSION configuration setting.
- Boolean values in request forms are now correctly parsed.
- Tests now run under Python 2.6.


Version 0.0.2
-------------

Released on November 27th 2012.

- Homepage/api entry point resource links fixed. They had bad 'href'
  tags which also caused XML validation issues when processing responses
  (especially when accessing the API via browser).

- Version number in 'Server' response headers.

- Added support for DELETE at resource endpoints. Expected behavior:
  will delete all items in the collection. Disabled by default.

- :class:`eve.io.mongo.Validator` now supports :class:`~cerberus.Validator`
  signature, allowing for further subclassing.

Version 0.0.1
-------------

Released on November 20th 2012.

- First public preview release.
