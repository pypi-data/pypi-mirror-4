<p>Hi ${user.first_name}</p>

<p>Yith Library sends you your passwords collection just in case something goes wrong with our servers.</p>

<p>You can use the attached file to import your passwords collection into a Yith Library server using the <em>Backup</em> menu inside your account. Here you have a quick link: <a href="${backups_link}">${backups_link}</a></p>

<p>You are receiving this email because the preference <em>Send my passwords to my email monthly</em> is set.</p>

<p>If you don't want to receive these mails anymore you can unset that preference at <a href="${preferences_link}">${preferences_link}</a>

<p>- The Yith Library team</p>
