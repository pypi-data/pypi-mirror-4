This package provides simple tools to process data from the CMIP5 archive distributed 
by the Earth System Grid Federation.

This package was developed by F. B. Laliberte and P. J. Kushner in the Atmospheric
Physics Group at the University of Toronto in 2011 and 2012. The main purpose of this
package is to provide simple tools to climate scientists and to help the 
"ExArch: Climate analytics on distributed exascale data archives" G8 Research Initiative grant.

Note that the included tool "cdb_driver" is still in alpha testing phase and might even disappear
in future releases.

FBL and PJK were funded by NSERC.
