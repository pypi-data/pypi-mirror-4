.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Specify the load\-based auto scaling configuration for a specified layer.
.IP Note
To use load\-based auto scaling, you must create a set of load\-based auto
scaling instances. Load\-based auto scaling operates only on the instances from
that set, so you must ensure that you have created enough instances to handle
the maximum anticipated load.

.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-down\-scaling\fP  (structure)
An \fBAutoScalingThresholds\fP object with the downscaling threshold
configuration. If the load falls below these thresholds for a specified amount
of time, OpsWorks stops a specified number of instances.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBinstance_count\fP  (integer)
The number of instances to add or remove when the load exceeds a threshold.
.TP
.B \fBload_threshold\fP  (double)
The load threshold. For more information about how load is computed, see
\fI\%Load (computing)\fP .
.TP
.B \fBthresholds_wait_time\fP  (integer)
The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed a threshold before
more instances are added or removed.
.TP
.B \fBignore_metrics_time\fP  (integer)
The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event occurs that OpsWorks
should ignore metrics and not raise any additional scaling events. For
example, OpsWorks adds new instances following an upscaling event but the
instances won\(aqt start reducing the load until they have been booted and
configured. There is no point in raising additional scaling events during
that operation, which typically takes several minutes. \fBIgnoreMetricsTime\fP
allows you to direct OpsWorks to not raise any scaling events long enough to
get the new instances online.
.TP
.B \fBmemory_threshold\fP  (double)
The memory utilization threshold, as a percent of the available memory.
.TP
.B \fBcpu_threshold\fP  (double)
The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the available CPU load.
