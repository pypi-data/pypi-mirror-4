Description: Python-Errordite
        ================
        
        This app provides integration between Python and Errordite, a centralised
        error logging and management service, not unlike Sentry, but with more
        functionality around the classification and management of errors.
        
        The application is provided in the form of a standard Python logging handler.
        In order to log exceptions with Errorite, you simply use ``logging.error`` or
        ``logging.exception`` in your ``except`` block::
        
            >>> import logging
            >>> import errordite
            >>> logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
            >>> logger.addHandler(errordite.ErrorditeHandler('token'))
            >>> try:
            ...    raise Exception()
            ... except:
            ...    # handler uses sys.exc_info() so no need to pass
            ...    # exception info explicitly.
            ...    logging.error("Something went wrong")
            >>>
        
        Details of the implementation are best found in the code itself - it's fairly
        self-explanatory.
        
        **Important info regarding sys.exc_info() and sys.exc_clear()**
        
        This logging handler is explicitly designed to capture and publish Python
        exceptions. It is not a generic logger, and as such it relies on the use of
        ``sys.exc_info()`` to determine whether there is anything to report. This can
        have an unexpected effect if you are logging items as errors that have no
        explicit exception attached, but where a previous exception has been swallowed.
        
        In the example below - we are catching and swallowing the DoesNotExist error
        because it's a known code path. However, the exception does still exist and
        if you call sys.exc_info() further on it will return this exception::
        
            try:
                .. do something that raises a known error - e.g. model.DoesNotExist
            except model.DoesNotExist:
                .. we half expected this, so just ignore it for now
        
        A little further on in our example we are logging a business exception (trying
        to checkout a negative basket value) but not attaching any explicit python
        error::
        
            .. continue on with the method
            .. some time later
        
            if basket_total < 0:
                logger.error("Someone tried to hack out checkout.")
        
        **In this case the wrong exception information will be recorded.**
        
        The solution to this is to call ``sys.exc_clear()`` in the ``except`` block
        so that the exception is removed explicitly. The Python docs state that:
        
         *This function is only needed in only a few obscure situations.*
        
        Which suggest that this is not recommended, however, they go on to state:
        
         *These include logging and error handling systems that report information
         on the last or current exception.*
        
        It is the author's opinion that this describes our exact predicament, and so
        the use of ``sys.exc_clear()`` is justified. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The library is available at pypi as 'errordite', and can therefore be
        installed using pip::
            
            $ pip install errordite
        
        Once installed you can import the handler::
        
            >>> import errordite
            >>> handler = errordite.ErrorditeHandler("your_errordite_token")
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        In order to set up a valid **ErrorditeHandler** you must pass in an
        Errordite API token, which you can get by signing up at http://www.errordite.com
        
        Tests
        -----
        
        There are tests in the package - they can be run using ``unittest``::
        
            $ python -m unittest errordite.tests
        
        NB These tests do log real exceptions over the wire, so you will need to be
        connected to the web to run them. You will also need to set a local environment
        variable (**ERRORDITE_TOKEN**), which is picked up in the test suite.
        
        If you are \*nix you can pass this in on the command line::
        
            $ ERRORDITE_TOKEN=123 python -m unittest errordite.tests
        
        If you are on Windows you'll need to set it up explicitly as an env var::
        
            c:\> set ERRORDITE_TOKEN=123
            c:\> python -m unittest errordite.tests
        
        (This is a technique used to prevent having to have sensitive information in
        the public repo.)
