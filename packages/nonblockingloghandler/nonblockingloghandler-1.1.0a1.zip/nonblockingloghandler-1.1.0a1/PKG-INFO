Description: 
        Provides a NonblockingLogHandler class consistent with the Python logging subsystem.
        
        This handler acts as a proxy for the another log handler that may be slow to execute: e.g. the SMTPHandler, SocketHandler,
        SysLogHandler - especially when they are talking to remote servers.
        
        If you have a real-time system (i.e. one where a late response is a wrong response) and you are sending log messages via email,
        http, syslog, etc., you should consider using this module to protect against unexpected delays.
        
        It is intended to be a drop-in replacement (with some minor provisos) for the proxied handler which returns quickly, and executes
        the actually logging in the background, in a separate thread.
