====================================
  Welcome to GC3Pie documentation!
====================================


--------------
 Introduction
--------------

GC3Pie is a Python package for running large job campaigns on diverse
batch-oriented execution environments (for instance: a Sun/Oracle/Open
`Grid Engine`_ cluster, or the Swiss National Distributed Computing
Infrastructure SMSCG_).  It also provides facilities for implementing
command-line driver scripts, in the form of Python object classes
whose behavior can be customized by overriding specified object
methods.

GC3Pie is comprised of three main components: 

- :ref:`GC3Libs`: A library of Python classes for controlling the life-cycle
  of a Grid or batch computational job collections. *GC3Libs* provides
  services for submitting computational jobs to Grids and batch
  systems and controlling their execution, persisting job information,
  and retrieving the final output.

- :ref:`GC3Apps`: A collection of driver scripts to run large job
  campaigns. These are all "glue scripts" to control hundreds or
  thousand job instances at once; they are used in production by
  various research groups, but are also publicly available as examples
  of GC3Libs coding.

- :ref:`GC3Utils`: This is a small set of low-level utilities to
  perform various control and cleanup tasks, like querying a job's
  running state (:command:`gstat`), forcibly terminating it
  (:command:`gkill`), re-submitting a job (:command:`gresub`), etc.
