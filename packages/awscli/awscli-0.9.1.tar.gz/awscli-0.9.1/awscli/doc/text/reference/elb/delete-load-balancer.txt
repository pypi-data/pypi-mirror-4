delete-load-balancer
********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes the specified LoadBalancer.

If attempting to recreate the LoadBalancer, the client must
reconfigure all the settings. The DNS name associated with a deleted
LoadBalancer will no longer be usable. Once deleted, the name and
associated DNS record of the LoadBalancer no longer exist and traffic
sent to any of its IP addresses will no longer be delivered to client
instances. The client will not receive the same DNS name even if a new
LoadBalancer with same --load-balancer-name is created.

To successfully call this API, the client must provide the same
account credentials as were used to create the LoadBalancer.

Note: By design, if the LoadBalancer does not exist or has already been
  deleted, delete-load-balancer still succeeds.
