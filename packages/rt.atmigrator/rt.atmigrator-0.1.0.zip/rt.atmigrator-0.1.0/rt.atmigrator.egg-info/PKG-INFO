Description: Introduction
        ============
        This simple package allows to migrate from a portal-type to another.
        This is done by `Products.contentmigration <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.contentmigration>`_, we only provide a simple interface that allows to select source and destination portal_types.
        
        Installation
        ============
        You only need to add the product to eggs and launch the buildout. No installation needed, is only a view.
        
        buildout.cfg::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=

        Usage
        =====
        To migrate some contents, you only need to call "*@@migrate-types*" view in site root.
        
        Remember to update the catalog after migration to align metadatas.
