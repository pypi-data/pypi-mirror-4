add-permission
**************


DESCRIPTION
===========

The add-permission action adds a permission to a queue for a specific
principal . This allows for sharing access to the queue.

When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the
queue. Only you (as owner of the queue) can grant or deny permissions
to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see Shared
Queues in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.

"add-permission" writes an SQS-generated policy. If you want to write
your own policy, use set-queue-attributes to upload your policy. For
more information about writing your own policy, see Appendix: The
Access Policy Language in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.
