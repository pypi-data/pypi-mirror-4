Title: Quick Lamson 1.0pre6 Release, More This Weekend

I put up a quick release of Lamson that fixes a bug in the gen project prototype.
I recently switched all the domain names being used in the test suite to "localhost" or
a similar nonexistant domain name.  Why?  Well, because some people liked to run
the Lamson test suite or their fresh project test suite against a *live* SMTP
server.  The test suite would "send" mail to test@test.com and my own 
address, under the assumption that people would use the @lamson log@ test server.

End result:  Periodically I'd get bounce messages from test.com and other test 
suite mail.

Well, I made that change, but forgot to update a couple places in the prototype, 
so newbies were seeing the tests for their fresh project fail and wondering 
if Lamson was broken.

Sorry about that.

You can grab this 1.0pre6 release from the "releases":/releases/ area, and
you can also do the usual @easy_install -U lamson@ to get it.

I'll be doing some more work to fix a few bugs this weekend and working on a 
fun new site for guitarists, so stay tuned.  And if there's something in particular
you want in Lamson just email the lamson@librelist.com mailing list.
