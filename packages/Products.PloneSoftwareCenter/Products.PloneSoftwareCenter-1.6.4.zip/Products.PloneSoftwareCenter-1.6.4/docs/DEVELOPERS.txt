Note to developers
==================

If you want to develop on PSC, you can use the buildout::

    $ python bootstrap.py
    $ bin/buildout

You will get a `test` script that can be use as-is to run all
tests over PSC::

    $ bin/test
    ...

This test is used for instance by a buildbot everytime a commit is
made in PSC. See http://buildbot.ingeniweb.com/waterfall, 
Products.PloneSoftwareCenter track.
