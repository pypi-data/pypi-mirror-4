Hello,

You have $ticket_count orphaned tickets.

This mean that those tickets are new but nobody is assigned to them since more than $delay day(s)
Most of the time it sound like nobody is working on your tickets.

This is perhaps a normal situation but you should ask someone to deal with them.

Best regard.
