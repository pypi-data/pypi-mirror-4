Client library for CodernityDB
==============================

CodernityDB-PyClient is a client library that targets to **100%**
compatibility between CodernityDB_ in embeded mode and
CodernityDB_ used with CodernityDB-HTTP_.

The remote errors will be the same as local ones, and remote traceback will be also included in it.

It will work perfectly even without CodernityDB in your system. That's possible by using python *import hook*.
