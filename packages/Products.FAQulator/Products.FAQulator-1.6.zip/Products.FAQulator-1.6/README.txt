Simple FAQ type
===============

This product implements a simple FAQ content type. A FAQ is a simple
folderish object which contains a list of questions and their answers. The
default FAQ view can optionally start with a simple header listing all
questions in the FAQ, which are linked to their answers.

Warning
=======

This is a 're release' to pypi to support existing installations/migration to
Plone 4. This FAQ product might not represent state of the art Plone add-on
development practices (Archetypes Inside(tm)), it's just fixed so it
continues to work with Plone 4.2.

Original version created by Amaze Solutions and Wichert Akkerman, version 1.6
made compatible for Plone 4.2/4.3 by Zest Software.
