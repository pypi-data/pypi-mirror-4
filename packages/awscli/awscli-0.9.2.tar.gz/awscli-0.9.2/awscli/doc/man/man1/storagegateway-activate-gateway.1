.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This operation activates the gateway you previously deployed on your VMware
host. For more information, see \fI\%Downloading and Deploying AWS Storage Gateway
VM\fP . In the activation process you specify information such as the
region you want to use for storing snapshots, the time zone for scheduled
snapshots and the gateway schedule window, an activation key, and a name for
your gateway. The activation process also associates your gateway with your
account (see  update\-gateway\-information ).
.IP Note
You must power on the gateway VM before you can activate your gateway.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS

.TP
.B \fB\-\-activation\-key\fP  (string)
Your gateway activation key. You can obtain the activation key by sending an
HTTP GET request with redirects enabled to the gateway IP address (port 80).
The redirect URL returned in the response provides you the activation key for
your gateway in the query string parameter \fBactivationKey\fP . It may also
include other activation\-related parameters, however, these are merely
defaults \-\- the arguments you pass to the \fBactivate\-gateway\fP API call
determine the actual configuration of your gateway.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gateway\-timezone\fP  (string)
One of the values that indicates the time zone you want to set for the
gateway. The time zone is used, for example, for scheduling snapshots and your
gateway\(aqs maintenance schedule.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-gateway\-region\fP  (string)
One of the values that indicates the region where you want to store the
snapshot backups. The gateway region specified must be the same region as the
region in your \fBHost\fP header in the request. For more information about
available regions and endpoints for AWS Storage Gateway, see \fI\%Regions and
Endpoints\fP
in the \fBAmazon Web Services Glossary\fP .
