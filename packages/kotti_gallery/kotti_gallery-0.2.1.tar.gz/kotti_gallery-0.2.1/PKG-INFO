Description: kotti_gallery
        =============
        
        This is an extension to the Kotti CMS that allows you to add image galleries to
        your Kotti site.
        
        It uses `Bootstrap Image Gallery`_ for the gallery view.

        Setup
        -----
        
        To activate the ``kotti_gallery`` add-on in your Kotti site, you need to add an
        entry to the ``kotti.configurators`` setting in your Paste Deploy config.  If
        you don't have a ``kotti.configurators`` option, add one.  The line in your
        ``[app:main]`` section could then look like this::
        
            kotti.configurators = kotti_gallery.kotti_configure
        
        With this, you'll be able to add galleries in your site.
