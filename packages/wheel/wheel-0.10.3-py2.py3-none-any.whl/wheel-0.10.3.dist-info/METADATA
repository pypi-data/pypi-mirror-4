Description: Wheel
        =====
        
        A built-package format for Python.
        
        A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and
        the .whl extension. It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP 376
        compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk format. Many
        packages will be properly installed with only the "Unpack" step
        (simply extracting the file onto sys.path), and the unpacked archive
        preserves enough information to "Spread" (copy data and scripts to their
        final locations) at any later time.
        
        The wheel project provides a `bdist_wheel` command for setuptools
        (requires distribute >= 0.6.28). Wheel files can be installed with a
        patched `pip` from https://github.com/dholth/pip.
        
        Why not egg?
        ------------
        
        Python's egg format predates the packaging related standards we have today,
        the most important being PEP 376 "Database of Installed Python Distributions"
        which specifies the .dist-info directory (instead of .egg-info) and PEP 345 
        "Metadata for Python Software Packages 1.2" which specifies how to express
        dependencies (instead of requires.txt in .egg-info).
        
        Wheel implements these things. It also provides a richer file naming
        convention that communicates the Python implementation and ABI as well as
        simply the language version used in a particular package.
        
        Unlike .egg, wheel will be a fully-documented standard at the binary level
        that is truly easy to install even if you do not want to use the reference
        implementation.
        
        
        
        0.10.3
        ======
        - Scripts fixer fix
        
        0.10.2
        ======
        - Fix keygen
        
        0.10.1
        ======
        - Preserve attributes on install.
        
        0.10.0
        ======
        - Include a copy of pkg_resources. Wheel can now install into a virtualenv
          that does not have distribute (though most packages still require
          pkg_resources to actually work; wheel install distribute)
        - Define a new setup.cfg section [wheel]. universal=1 will
          apply the py2.py3-none-any tag for pure python wheels.
        
        0.9.7
        =====
        - Only import dirspec when needed. dirspec is only needed to find the
          configuration for keygen/signing operations.
        
        0.9.6
        =====
        - requires-dist from setup.cfg overwrites any requirements from setup.py
          Care must be taken that the requirements are the same in both cases,
          or just always install from wheel.
        - drop dirspec requirement on win32
        - improved command line utility, adds 'wheel convert [egg or wininst]' to
          convert legacy binary formats to wheel
        
        0.9.5
        =====
        - Wheel's own wheel file can be executed by Python, and can install itself: 
          ``python wheel-0.9.5-py27-none-any/wheel install ...`` 
        - Use argparse; basic ``wheel install`` command should run with only stdlib
          dependencies.
        - Allow requires_dist in setup.cfg's [metadata] section. In addition to
          dependencies in setup.py, but will only be interpreted when installing
          from wheel, not from sdist. Can be qualified with environment markers.
        
        0.9.4
        =====
        - Fix wheel.signatures in sdist
        
        0.9.3
        =====
        - Integrated digital signatures support without C extensions.
        - Integrated "wheel install" command (single package, no dependency
          resolution) including compatibility check.
        - Support Python 3.3
        - Use Metadata 1.3 (PEP 426)
        
        0.9.2
        =====
        - Automatic signing if WHEEL_TOOL points to the wheel binary
        - Even more Python 3 fixes
        
        0.9.1
        =====
        - 'wheel sign' uses the keys generated by 'wheel keygen' (instead of generating
          a new key at random each time)
        - Python 2/3 encoding/decoding fixes
        - Run tests on Python 2.6 (without signature verification)
        
        0.9
        ===
        - Updated digital signatures scheme
        - Python 3 support for digital signatures
        - Always verify RECORD hashes on extract
        - "wheel" command line tool to sign, verify, unpack wheel files
        
        0.8
        ===
        - none/any draft pep tags update
        - improved wininst2wheel script
        - doc changes and other improvements
        
        0.7

        - pep8
        - scripts to convert wininst & egg to wheel
        
        0.6
        ===
        - require distribute >= 0.6.28
        - stop using verlib

        - working pretty well

        - prototype egg2wheel conversion script
        
        0.2
