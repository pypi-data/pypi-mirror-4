Description: # Swatch
        
        swatch is a parser for adobe swatch exchange files
        
        Copyright (c) 2012 Marcos A Ojeda http://generic.cx/
        
        
        With help from ASE documentation written by [Carl Camera](http://iamacamera.org/default.aspx?id=109) and
        the ase generator written for colourlovers by [Chris Williams](http://www.colourlovers.com/ase.phps)
        
        
        `swatch.parse` reads in an ase file and converts it to a list of colors and
        palettes. colors are simple dicts of the form
        
            {
                'name': u'color name',
                'type': u'Process',
                'data': {
                    'mode': u'RGB',
                    'values': [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
                }
            }
        
        the values provided vary between color mode. For all color modes, the
        value is always a list of floats.
        
        RGB: three floats between [0,1]  corresponding to RGB.
        CMYK: four floats between [0,1] inclusive, corresponding to CMYK.
        Gray: one float between [0,1] with 1 being white, 0 being black.
        LAB: three floats. The first L, is ranged from 0,1. Both A and B are
        floats ranging from [-128.0,127.0]. I believe illustrator just crops
        these to whole values, though.
        
        Palettes (Color Groups in Adobe Parlance) are also dicts, but they have an
        attribute named `swatches` which contains a list of colors contained within
        the palette.
        
            {
                'name': u'accent colors',
                'type': u'Color Group',
                'swatches': [
                    {color}, {color}, ..., {color}
                ]
            }
        
        Because Adobe Illustrator lets swatches exist either inside and outside
        of palettes, the output of swatch.parse is a list that may contain
        swatches and palettes, i.e. [ swatch* palette* ]
        
        Here's an example with a light grey swatch followed by a color group containing three
        
            >>> import swatch
            >>> swatch.parse("example.ase")
            [{'data': {'mode': u'Gray', 'values': [0.75]},
              'name': u'Light Grey',
              'type': u'Process'},
             {'name': u'Accent Colors',
              'swatches': [{'data': {'mode': u'CMYK',
                 'values': [0.5279774069786072,
                  0.24386966228485107,
                  1.0,
                  0.04303044080734253]},
                'name': u'Green',
                'type': u'Process'},
               {'data': {'mode': u'CMYK',
                 'values': [0.6261844635009766,
                  0.5890134572982788,
                  3.051804378628731e-05,
                  3.051804378628731e-05]},
                'name': u'Violet Process Global',
                'type': u'Global'},
               {'data': {'mode': u'LAB', 'values': [0.6000000238418579, -35.0, -5.0]},
                'name': u'Cyan Spot (global)',
                'type': u'Spot'}],
