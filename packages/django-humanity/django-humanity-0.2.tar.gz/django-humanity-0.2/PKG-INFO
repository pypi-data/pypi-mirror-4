Description: django-humanity: PROVE YOU ARE HUMAN!
        =====================================
        
        The robots are trying to take over the world. Ensure that your forms
        are used only by humans.
        
        django-humanity adds a simple mathematical equation to your form that users
        must solve in order to submit. Computers are notoriously terrible at math,
        so this is a task that only humans (or maybe dolphins) can accomplish.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Create your form as a subclass of HumanityForm::
        
            from humanity.forms import HumanityForm
        
            class MyForm(HumanityForm):
                pass
        
        That's it! Just include the form in your template and everything will be
        handled for you.
