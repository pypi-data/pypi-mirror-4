        Cutlass is a Python (2.7+) library for making web app backends.
        
        It's a small, carefully-designed set of components which do basic jobs usually
        done by a framework, without needing to be used together. Dependencies,
        internal coupling, automatic behavior and magic are kept to a minimum. These
        components snap together flexibly with each other and anything else that uses
        WSGI, including most Python frameworks as well as best-of-breed libraries like
        WebOb, Bottle and Werkzeug. (You don't have to know about WSGI, though you can
        easily work at that level if you need to.)
        
        This design lets you get started quickly, completely understand and control
        what your app is doing, keep overhead down, and tailor your architecture and
        components to your tastes and tasks.
