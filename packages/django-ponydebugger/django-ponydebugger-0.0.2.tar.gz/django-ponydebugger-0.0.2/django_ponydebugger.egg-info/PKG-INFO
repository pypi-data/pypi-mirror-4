Description: django-ponydebugger
        ===================
        
        `PonyDebugger`_ is a remote debugging toolset that uses Chrome Developer
        Tools. It consists of 2 parts: a server (`ponyd`_) and an iOS client
        library so you can debug your iOS apps.
        
        This project adds a Python client for debugging `Django`_ web apps.

        Features
        --------
        
        -  Network Traffic Debugging
        
           View all requests received by Django, including request and response
           headers and bodies.
        
        -  Console
        
           Interact with the running process with a fully functional console.
        
        Installation / Setup / Usage
        ----------------------------
        
        Install the django-ponydebugger package and its dependencies with the
        following command:
        
        ::
        
            pip install django-ponydebugger
        
        Update your Django settings module to add
        ``django_ponydebugger.middleware.PonyMiddleware`` to
        ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` (preferably near the beginning).
        
        After receiving the first request, django-ponydebugger will connect to
        ponyd. Connect to ponyd with your browser (probably
        http://127.0.0.1:9000/), and you should see Django listed. After
        clicking on Django, django-ponydebugger will report events to
        PonyDebugger / Chrome Developer Tools.
        
        Known Issues
        ------------
        
        None
        
        Future Work
        -----------
        
        -  Timeline support. It would be nice to report received HTTP requests
           as well as other events related to the request (like DB queries) to
           the Timeline.
