.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The release\-address operation releases an elastic IP address associated with
your account.
.IP Note
Releasing an IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance with
which it is associated. For more information, see DisassociateAddress.
.RE
.IP Warning
After releasing an elastic IP address, it is released to the IP address pool
and might no longer be available to your account. Make sure to update your DNS
records and any servers or devices that communicate with the address.
.sp
If you run this operation on an elastic IP address that is already released,
the address might be assigned to another account which will cause Amazon EC2
to return an error.
