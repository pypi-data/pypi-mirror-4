create-route
************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a new route in a route table within a VPC. The route's target
can be either a gateway attached to the VPC or a NAT instance in the
VPC.

When determining how to route traffic, we use the route with the most
specific match. For example, let's say the traffic is destined for
"192.0.2.3" , and the route table includes the following two routes:

* "192.0.2.0/24" (goes to some target A)

* "192.0.2.0/28" (goes to some target B)

Both routes apply to the traffic destined for "192.0.2.3" . However,
the second route in the list is more specific, so we use that route to
determine where to target the traffic.

For more information about route tables, go to Route Tables in the
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide.
