Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package makes `Products.CMFEditions`_ works with `Dexterity`_ content types.
        
        In general CMFEditions works ok with Dexterity. The only problem is the ``versions_history_form``
        template: it does not show the older versions for Dexterity content items. Also, it may break if
        the custom content type does not use the default view auto-generated by Dexterity.
        
        This package solve this problem by overriding ``versions_history_form``.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The usual: add this package to the buildout and install the Generic Setup profile in the Plone Site.
        
        Extension/customization points
        ==============================
        
        To make the ``versions_history_form`` template work with Dexterity content types some views were
        created. These can be overriden to customize the way older versions of a content type are displayed:
        
        - ``@@download-version``: Downloads an older version of a file stored in a ``plone.namedfile``
          field.
        - ``@@content-core``: Render only the ``content-core`` div of the default view of a content item.  
        - ``@@version-view``: Same as ``@@content-core`` but makes links to file downloads use the 
          ``@@download-version`` view.
