.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the AWS Data Pipeline service on the progress of the calling task
runner. When the task runner is assigned a task, it should call
report\-task\-progress to acknowledge that it has the task within 2 minutes. If
the web service does not recieve this acknowledgement within the 2 minute
window, it will assign the task in a subsequent  poll\-for\-task call. After this
initial acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress every 15
minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting
time from 15 minutes by specifying a \fBreportProgressTimeout\fP field in your
pipeline. If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data
Pipeline will assume that the task runner is unable to process the task and will
reassign the task in a subsequent response to  poll\-for\-task . task runners
should call report\-task\-progress every 60 seconds.
