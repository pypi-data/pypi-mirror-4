Description: ==================================
        Python bindings for SpinChimp API.
        ==================================
        
        `Spin Chimp <http://spinchimp.com>`_ is an online
        service for spinning text (synonym substitution) that creates unique version(s)
        of existing text. This package provides a way to easily interact with
        `SpinChimp API <http://spinchimp.com/api>`_.
        Usage requires an API subscription, `get it here <http://spinchimp.com/api>`_.
