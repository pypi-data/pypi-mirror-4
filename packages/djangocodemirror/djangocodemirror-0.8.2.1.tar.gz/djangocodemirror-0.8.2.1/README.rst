Introduction
============

**Django-CodeMirror** is a Django application to embed the `CodeMirror`_ editor.

It was designed to be used in **sveedocuments**, so it is suited for a 
`ReStructuredText`_ environment but `CodeMirror`_ support a large range of syntax 
coloration modes (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, HTML, etc..). It is essentialy a jQuery 
plugin on top of `CodeMirror`_ to add some features like :

* A button bar with keyboard shortcuts to use some syntax element in your text;
* A maximize mode to resize the editor at full browser size;
* A preview mode;
* A quicksave option;
* Support translations with english and french allready shipped;
* Compatibility with `Django CSRF`_.

**NOTE :** Since the version 3.0, CodeMirror does not really support IE7 and so Django-CodeMirror too.

Links
*****

* Download his 
  `PyPi package <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangocodemirror>`_;
* Clone it on his 
  `Github repository <https://github.com/sveetch/djangocodemirror>`_;
* Documentation and demo on 
  `DjangoSveetchies page <http://sveetchies.sveetch.net/djangocodemirror/>`_.

Requires
========

Your project will have to includes a copy of these Javascript libraries :

* `jQuery`_ >= 1.7;
* `CodeMirror`_ but it is included as a git submodule;

Install
=======

The easiest method to install it, is with ``pip`` like this : ::

    pip install djangocodemirror

Or installing it like you want from the Github repository.

Settings
********

In your *settings* file add the app to your installed apps :

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'djangocodemirror',
        ...
    )

And you will need to have a copy of `CodeMirror`_ in your *statics* directory (see 
`Django staticfiles`_). The jQuery library must be called by your templates, 
**Django-CodeMirror** don't do it for you.

Getting CodeMirror
******************

`CodeMirror`_ is included as a git submodule, so you can install it from Github. Within the root of the **Django-CodeMirror** repository do this : ::

    git submodule update --init

This is optionnal, if you want you can download it and install it yourself.

If you have used ``pip`` to install **Django-CodeMirror**, you don't have to mind about this as `CodeMirror`_ is allready shipped in the PyPi package.

Usage
=====

DjangoCodeMirror
****************

`DjangoCodeMirror`_ is the `jQuery`_ plugin on top of `CodeMirror`_, it accepts all 
`CodeMirror`_ options and some additional :

fullscreen
    This enable the maximize mode at ``true``. It is enabled by default.
help_link
    Help page link to put in button bar if filled. If the string is empty there will be 
    no help button displayed. When clicked the link is opened in a new window.
quicksave_url
    When the string is not empty, it is used as the URL to send data in **POST** request 
    where the view receiver should save the data. This is disabled by default. If the 
    ``csrf`` option is enabled, it will be used in the request.
    
    The default sended datas are :
    
    * ``nocache`` : a timestamp used to block some browser caching, this can be ignored;
    * ``content`` : the textarea content.
    
    More datas can be sended with the ``quicksave_datas`` option.
quicksave_datas
    Expect an object ``{...}`` whose variables will be sended as data in *quicksave* 
    request.
    
    Or it can be a *string* that determine a variable name to find the object in the 
    global context. This is useful if you want to use a variable that can change and not 
    a defined object at page load. 
preview_url
    When the string is not empty, it is used as the URL to send data in **POST** request 
    where the view receiver should render the content with a parser. The excepted 
    response must return the HTML fragment rendered. This is disabled by default. If the 
    ``csrf`` option is enabled, it will be used in the request.
    
    The default sended datas are :
    
    * ``nocache`` : a timestamp used to block some browser caching, this can be ignored;
    * ``content`` : the textarea content.
csrf
    Expect a *string* containing the function name which be used to modify a request to 
    add it the needed *token* by `Django CSRF`_. The token will be injected in the 
    request headers. A ready to use function is allready shipped.
    
    The function have two required arguments :
    
    * xhr : the `jQuery`_ XMLHTTPRequest to be modified;
    * settings : the settings object used with `jQuery.ajax()`_.
    
    You should see the option ``beforeSend`` of `jQuery.ajax()`_ for more details, this 
    is where the csrf function is really used.
display_cursor_position
    At ``True`` it enable the display of current line and column in the bottom right of 
    the editor. This option is enabled by default.
no_tab_char
    At ``True`` the usage of the tabulation key will not write a tabulation character and 
    spaces will be writed in replacment. The number of spaces will be determined from the 
    *tabSize* option (default to 4) from CodeMirror.
undo_buttons
    At ``True`` it display buttons *Undo* and *Redo* in the buttons bar. Enabled by 
    default.
settings_cookie
    When the string is not empty, it is used as the cookie name where to search settings 
    to overwrite the default ones (of Django-CodeMirror).
search_enabled
    Only for your application settings, the plugin doesn't know of this option. At 
    ``True`` this will enable the *search & replace* feature of `CodeMirror`_. This is 
    enabled by default for `DjangoCodeMirrorField`_ and the demo settings.

A full example of these settings with the plugin :

::
    
    <div>
        <textarea id="id_content" rows="10" cols="40" name="content"></textarea>
        <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
        //<![CDATA[
            my_datas = {'foo': 'bar'};
            $(document).ready(function() {
                id_content_codemirror_instance = $('#id_content').djangocodemirror({
                    "mode": "rst",
                    "csrf": "CSRFpass",
                    "fullscreen": true,
                    "help_link": "/help/",
                    "quicksave_url": "/djangocodemirror-sample/quicksave/",
                    "quicksave_datas": my_datas,
                    "preview_url": "/djangocodemirror-sample/preview/",
                    "display_cursor_position": true,
                    "no_tab_char": true,
                    "undo_buttons": true,
                    "settings_cookie": "djancocodemirror_settings",
                    "lineNumbers": true
                });
            });
        //]]>
        </script>
    </div>

The plugin use some additional libraries (allready shipped) :

* `jquery.cookies <http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie>`_;
* `qTip2`_;

.. NOTE:: If you directly use the plugin, you will have to load yourself all needed 
          libaries, see `Fields medias`_ for a details of these.

.. WARNING:: Previous versions (<0.7.2) was automatically loading the Javascript init 
             for the field. This is not the default behavior anymore. You should see the 
             ``embed_settings`` widget attribute to enable this behavior. Else you will 
             use the default behavior and manually load the needed Javascript using the 
             given `Template tags`_.

CodeMirrorWidget
****************

This is the widget to use in your form fields to apply them an instance of 
`DjangoCodeMirror`_ or `CodeMirror`_. It is accessible at 
``djangocodemirror.fields.CodeMirrorWidget``.

Usage example on a form field :

::

    from djangocodemirror.fields import CodeMirrorWidget
    
    class CodeMirrorSampleForm(forms.Form):
        content = forms.CharField(label=u"Your content", widget=CodeMirrorWidget)
        
        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return

The widget accept two additional arguments :

* ``codemirror_only`` A *boolean* to disable the `DjangoCodeMirror`_ usage at benefit of 
  `CodeMirror`_. It is ``False`` by default;
* ``codemirror_attrs`` : A *dict* to define the editor settings. It is empty by default.
* ``embed_settings`` : A *boolean* to active the automatic embed of the needed 
  Javascript code to launch a CodeMirror instance for the field. This is ``False`` 
  by default because there is lots of possible scenarios to manage your assets and 
  Javascript code. So if you active this, DjangoCodeMirror assets must be loaded 
  BEFORE your field appear in the HTML code;

Another example where the ``content`` field will be a `CodeMirror`_ editor with enabled 
line numbers :

::

    from djangocodemirror.fields import CodeMirrorWidget
    
    class CodeMirrorSampleForm(forms.Form):
        content = forms.CharField(label="Your content", widget=CodeMirrorWidget(codemirror_only=True, codemirror_attrs={'lineNumbers':True}))
        
        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return

Medias
------

The widget load automatically all his needed medias and static files, you just have to 
put this in your templates : ::

  {{ form.media }}

This behavior is inherited by `DjangoCodeMirrorField`_ and `CodeMirrorField`_.

CodeMirrorField
***************

This inherit from ``django.forms.CharField`` to automatically use `CodeMirrorWidget`_ as 
the widget field. The widget set the ``codemirror_only`` attribute to ``True`` to use 
only the `CodeMirror`_ editor.

It take an additional named argument ``codemirror_attrs`` like `CodeMirrorWidget`_, his 
default value correspond to the ``default`` setting of `CODEMIRROR_SETTINGS`_.

::

    from django import forms
    from djangocodemirror.fields import CodeMirrorField
    
    class CodeMirrorSampleForm(forms.Form):
        content_codemirror = CodeMirrorField(label=u"Your content", codemirror_attrs={'lineNumbers':True})
        
        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return

DjangoCodeMirrorField
*********************

It is identical as `CodeMirrorField`_ but for usage of `DjangoCodeMirror`_ as the widget 
field.

His default value for ``codemirror_attrs`` correspond to 
`DJANGOCODEMIRROR_DEFAULT_SETTING`_.

::

    from django import forms
    from djangocodemirror.fields import CodeMirrorField
    
    class CodeMirrorSampleForm(forms.Form):
        content_djangocodemirror = DjangoCodeMirrorField(label=u"Your content", codemirror_attrs={'lineNumbers':True})
        
        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            return

Application settings
====================

All default app settings is located in the ``settings_local.py`` file of 
``djangocodemirror``, you can modify them in your project settings.

.. NOTE:: All app settings are overwritten if present in your project settings with the 
          exception of dict variables. This is to be remembered when you want to add a 
          new entry in a list variable, you will have to copy the default version in 
          your settings with the new entry otherwise default variable will be lost.

CODEMIRROR_FIELD_INIT_JS
************************

**Type :** *string*

HTML code to instantiate `CodeMirror`_ in form fields, this is a template string (usable 
with ``String.format()``) which expect two variable places :

* ``{inputid}`` : Will be the unique field id;
* ``{settings}`` : Will be a JSON string representation of the editor settings.

DJANGOCODEMIRROR_FIELD_INIT_JS

The default available settings schemes are :

* ``default`` : Only for enable the option to show line numbers;
* ``djangocodemirror`` : Minimal options for `DjangoCodeMirror`_ (line numbers and mode 
  ``rst`` for `ReStructuredText`_);

Template tags
=============

You will need to load the template tags module in your templates like this : ::

    {% load djangocodemirror_inputs %}

Filters
*******

djangocodemirror_input_settings
    Get the generated widget settings and return it as JSON. It take the form field as required argument like this : ::
    
        {{ form.content|djangocodemirror_input_settings }}
djangocodemirror_init_input
    Return the HTML tag to embed the Javascript init for a djangocodemirror input field. Take the same argument as ``djangocodemirror_input_settings``.

Sample demonstration
====================

You can rapidly insert **Django-CodeMirror** in your project in adding 
``djangocodemirror.urls`` to your project ``urls.py`` file. This will use 
``djangocodemirror.views`` which contains the demonstration views.

::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        (r'^djangocodemirror-sample/', include('djangocodemirror.urls')),
        ...
    )

Three views are avalaible :

* The editor demonstration on ``djangocodemirror-sample/`` using `ReStructuredText`_;
* The preview view ``preview/`` used in editor demo, it require **sveedocuments** to 
  work correctly or it will simply return a dummy content. This view accepts only 
  **POST** request and return an empty response for all request type (like GET);
* The quicksave view ``quicksave/`` used in editor demo, doesn't really save anything, 
  just do some validation. It require **sveedocuments** to work correctly.
* A public view ``settings/`` usable to edit some settings for the editor. These 
  custom settings will be saved in a cookie. 

Internationalization and localization
=====================================

This application make usage of the `Django internationalization system`_ only in his 
demonstration. However the editor is translated with his own system using a javascript 
file for each available language.

To add a new language, you will have to add a new javascript file that will register the 
new available language. Just create a file with this :

::

    DCM_Translations["NAME"] = {
        // Translations goes here
    };

Where ``NAME`` is the language locale name to register and ``// Translations goes here`` 
must be replaced by the content to translate. To see a full translation see the french 
version in ``static/djangocodemirror/djangocodemirror.fr.js`` where you can see all the 
string to translate.

You can save your file where you want in your project or application, you will just have 
to register it in the setting `DJANGOCODEMIRROR_TRANSLATIONS`_.
