        Overview
        --------
        
        Integrates the `Disqus`_ commenting platform into Plone.
        
        Default Plone discussion mechanism doesn't have a nice panel to administer
        comments. It's hard to find new comments. It's not possible to block posts
        with links or any other unwelcome contents.
        
        However there are much more specialized tools for commenting on the web:
        
        * `Disqus`_
        * `IntenseDebate`_
        * `JS-Kit`_
        
        These commenting platforms can be easily integrated with sites, users just
        need to create an account and add some special code into their websites.
        
        .. WARNING:: 
           Versions 2.0 and up are not backwards compatible. If you are coming from an
           old version, you'll need to write your own upgrade code, or simply
           manually uninstall the old package before installing the new one.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        To enable Disqus comments in your site you need to:
        
        * Enable Global comments from Plone's default "Discussion settings" tool from
          control panel
        * Go to Disqus control panel and enable "Activate Disqus as system comment for
          Plone"
        * Enter your blog's short name as provided by Disqus
        
        Now a Disqus comment box should be shown for each content type that has
        comments enabled.
        
        Comments count
        --------------
        
        The product provides a 'Disqus summary view' that you can apply to any
        folderish or collection-type content type. It will show a comments count
        next to the "Read more..." link of each element.
        
        In addition, there's a counter beneath the title of any object that accepts
        comments. This is done through a viewlet named as "disqus.comments.count".
        
        Portlets
        --------
        
        This product provides 2 portlets that you can use:
        
        * `Hot threads`_
        * `Popular threads`_
        
        They both use the Disqus API, and for them to work, you need to provide:
        
        * Access token
        * Public key
        * Secret key
        
        And to get them, you need to register an `API Disqus account`_

        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        1. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.disqus`` to the list of eggs to
           install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.disqus
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.disqus`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource
        registries in order to see the effects of the product installation.
