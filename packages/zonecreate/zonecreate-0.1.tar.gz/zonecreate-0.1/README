zonecreate
==========

zonecreate is a very simple Python project that contains a couple of different
scripts/templates that make it easier to manage various different zone files
that are in the standard zone file format (BIND/NSD).


Scripts
-------

 - zone_create
    Is used to create a new zone file, contains the standard stuff, SOA record
    and some NS records. Nothing else.

 - zone_update_soa
    This is used to update the SOA record of a zone file. Given a zone file it
    will grab the current SOA record, and update the serial number to the
    current date + a counter. This way the zone file can be updated twice in
    the same day and the serial will correctly have increased.
