Description: Simple FAQ type
        ===============
        
        This product implements a simple FAQ content type. A FAQ is a simple
        folderish object which contains a list of questions and their answers. The
        default FAQ view can optionally start with a simple header listing all
        questions in the FAQ, which are linked to their answers.
        
        Warning
        =======
        
        This is a 're release' to pypi to support existing installations/migration to
        Plone 4. This FAQ product might not represent state of the art Plone add-on
        development practices (Archetypes Inside(tm)), it's just fixed so it
        continues to work with Plone 4.2.
