        A simple but working Finnish language hyphenator.
        
        By Pyry Kontio a.k.a Drasa (Drasa@IRCnet, pyry.kontio@drasa.eu)
        
        Hyphenates Finnish text with Unicode soft hyphens. (U+00AD) Mainly intended for server-
        side-hyphenation of web sites.
        	
        Allows to set hyphenation-preventing character margins for words so that they won't
        break right at the start or the end. (For example, it'd be a bit silly - although certainly
        possible in Finnish language - to break a word like 'erikoinen' at 'e-rikoinen'.
        With default margin of 2, it breaks more stylistically pleasingly, 'eri-koinen'.)
        
        Hyphenated html tags break web sites, so there's the boolean argument skip_html.
        That enabled, it skips over all the words that are contained between "<" and ">" characters.
        	
        Usage:
        as a standalone script:
        
        hyphenate_finnish.py [margin] [text]
        
        or as a Python module:
        
        from hyphenate_finnish import hyphenate; hyphenate("some text but <html> isn't gonna get hyphenated!", margin=1, skip_html=True)
        
        It's that simple.
        By the way, written in Py3k, but it seems to work with 2.7 too.
