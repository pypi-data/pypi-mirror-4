        dj-email-url
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This utiliy is based on dj-database-url by Kenneth Reitz.
        
        It allows to utilize the
        `12factor <http://www.12factor.net/backing-services>`_ inspired
        environments variable to configure the email backend in a Django application.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Configure your email configuration values in ``settings.py`` from
        ``EMAIL_URL``::
        
            email_config = dj_email_url.config()
        
        Parse an arbitrary email URL::
        
            email_config = dj_email_url.parse('smtp://...')
        
        
        After this, it is necessary to assign values to settings::
        
            EMAIL_FILE_PATH = email_config['EMAIL_FILE_PATH']
            EMAIL_HOST_USER = email_config['EMAIL_HOST_USER']
            EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = email_config['EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD']
            EMAIL_HOST = email_config['EMAIL_HOST']
            EMAIL_PORT = email_config['EMAIL_PORT']
            EMAIL_BACKEND = email_config['EMAIL_BACKEND']
        
        
        Supported backends
        ------------------
        
        Currently, it supports:
        
        - SMTP backend (smtp or smtps),
        
        - console backend (console),
        
        - file backend (file),
        
        - in-memory backend (memory),
        
        - and dummy backend (dummy).
        
        
        The scheme ``smtps`` indicates to use TLS connections, that is to set
        ``EMAIL_USE_TLS`` to ``True``.
        
        The file backend is the only one which needs a path. The url path is store
        in ``EMAIL_FILE_PATH`` key.
