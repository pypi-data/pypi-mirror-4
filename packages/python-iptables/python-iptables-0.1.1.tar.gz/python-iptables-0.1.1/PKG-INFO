Description: 
        Python Bindings for IPtables:
        
        Iptables is the tool that is used to manage netfilter, the standard packet filtering and manipulation framework under Linux. As the iptables manpage puts it:
        Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined.
        Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user- defined chains.
        Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This is called a target, which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.
        Python-iptables provides python bindings to iptables under Linux. Interoperability with iptables is achieved via using the iptables C libraries (libiptc, libxtables, and the iptables extensions), not calling the iptables binary and parsing its output.
        
        See http://ldx.github.com/python-iptables/ for documentation.
