authorize-cluster-security-group-ingress
****************************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Adds an inbound (ingress) rule to an security group. Depending on
whether the application accessing your cluster is running on the
Internet or an EC2 instance, you can authorize inbound access to
either a Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) IP address range or an
EC2 security group. You can add as many as 20 ingress rules to an
security group.

Note: The EC2 security group must be defined in the AWS region where the
  cluster resides.

For an overview of CIDR blocks, see the Wikipedia article on Classless
Inter-Domain Routing .

You must also associate the security group with a cluster so that
clients running on these IP addresses or the EC2 instance are
authorized to connect to the cluster. For information about managing
security groups, go to Working with Security Groups in the *Amazon
Redshift Management Guide* .
