Description: Attribute-accesible collections inspired by `stuf
        <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/stuf>`_. Implements ``chainstuf`` and
        ``counterstuf``: versions of ``ChainMap`` and ``Counter`` that expose their keys as
        attributes.
        
        The ultimate goal of this module is to have these functions available in the
        ``stuf`` module, and this sidecar to be retired.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Use these just like you would ``ChainMap`` and ``Counter``, except that
        you get attribute-style access as well.
        
        For ``chainstuf``::
        
            from chainstuf import chainstuf
            
            d1 = dict(this=1, that=2)
            d2 = dict(roger=99, that=100)
            
            # test simple attribute equivalence
            c = chainstuf(d1, d2)
            
            assert c.this == 1
            assert c.roger == 99
            
            c.roger = 'wilco'
            assert c.roger
            print "roger", c.roger
            
            d1.update(feeling='fancypants!')
            print "i'm feeling", c.feeling     # passed through, since d2 lacks 'feeling'
        
        For ``counterstuf``::
        
            from counterstuf import counterstuf
            
            c = counterstuf()
            c.update("this and this is this but that isn't this".split())
            c.total = sum(c.values())
            
            print "everything:", c.total
            print "'this' mentioned", c.this, "times"
            print "'bozo' mentioned", c.bozo, "times"
            print c
            
        **NB** ``counterstuf`` does not yet function under Python 2.6, since it
        does not have a ``collections.Counter``. It doesn't have a ``ChainMap``,
        either, but we have a workaround for that (piggyback ``stuf.ChainMap``).
        Will have to acquire a suitable ``Counter`` workaround for 2.6.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
         * Commenced automated multi-version testing with
           `pytest <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`_
           and `tox <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox>`_.
           
         * Now
           successfully packaged for, and tested against, Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3.
           (With the exception of ``counterstuf`` under 2.6, as described above.)

        Installation
        ============
        
        ::
        
            pip install otherstuf
        
        To ``easy_install`` under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example)::
        
            python3.3 -m easy_install otherstuf
            
        (You may need to prefix these with "sudo " to authorize installation.)
