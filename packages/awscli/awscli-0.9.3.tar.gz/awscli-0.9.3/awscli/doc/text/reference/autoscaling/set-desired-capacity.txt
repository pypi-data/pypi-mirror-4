set-desired-capacity
********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Adjusts the desired size of the  AutoScalingGroup by initiating
scaling activities. When reducing the size of the group, it is not
possible to define which Amazon EC2 instances will be terminated. This
applies to any Auto Scaling decisions that might result in terminating
instances.

There are two common use cases for "set-desired-capacity" : one for
users of the Auto Scaling triggering system, and another for
developers who write their own triggering systems. Both use cases
relate to the concept of cooldown.

In the first case, if you use the Auto Scaling triggering system,
"set-desired-capacity" changes the size of your Auto Scaling group
without regard to the cooldown period. This could be useful, for
example, if Auto Scaling did something unexpected for some reason. If
your cooldown period is 10 minutes, Auto Scaling would normally reject
requests to change the size of the group for that entire 10-minute
period. The "set-desired-capacity" command allows you to circumvent
this restriction and change the size of the group before the end of
the cooldown period.

In the second case, if you write your own triggering system, you can
use "set-desired-capacity" to control the size of your Auto Scaling
group. If you want the same cooldown functionality that Auto Scaling
offers, you can configure "set-desired-capacity" to honor cooldown by
setting the "--honor-cooldown" parameter to "true" .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity
     --auto-scaling-group-name <value>
     --desired-capacity <value>
     [--honor-cooldown ]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--auto-scaling-group-name"  (string)
   The name of the Auto Scaling group.

"--desired-capacity"  (integer)
   The new capacity setting for the Auto Scaling group.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--honor-cooldown"  (boolean)
   By default, "set-desired-capacity" overrides any cooldown period.
   Set to "True" if you want Auto Scaling to reject this request when
