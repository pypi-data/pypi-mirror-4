Description: Crawl
        =====
        
        Crawl is a port of the Ruby gem
        `Hike <https://github.com/sstephenson/hike>`_ to Python. Crawl will scan
        through a list of given folders for a requested file. You can also
        configure it to just match any of a given list of extensions.
        
        While Crawl does work at the basic level, it is not yet a complete port
        of Hike, as it doesn't implement Hike's index caching for speedier
        responses, although I do intend to add that.
