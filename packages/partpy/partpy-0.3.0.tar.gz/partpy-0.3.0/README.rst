partpy
------

Parser Tools in Python (``partpy``, pronounced ``Par-Tee-Pie``), a
collection of tools for hand writing lexers and parsers in python.

There are many parser generators but there isn't much help for those
who wish to roll their own parser/lexer as counter-intuitive as that
may sound. ``partpy`` provides a solid base for hand written parsers
and lexers through a library of common tools.

By using ``partpy`` as the base for your own parser or lexer the hope
is to provide you with an environment where you can dive straight into
the language design, recognition and whatever else you need to do
without having to figure out how string matching should be done or
most of the error handling process.
