Changelog
=========

* 0.1.6
    * Header detection was relying on case. However it is possible for a lower
      case version of headers to show up. Those are now handled correctly.
* 0.1.4
    * Added a function to remove tags, in addition stripped 'sectPr' tags since
      they have to do with headers and footers.
* 0.1.3
    * Hyperlinks with no text no longer throw an error
    * Fixed a bug with determining the font size with an incomplete styles dict
* 0.1.2
    * Fixed a bug with determining the font size of a paragraph tag
* 0.1.1
    * Added a changelog
    * Styles are now stripped from hyperlinks
    * jinja2 is now used to render test xml
* 0.1.0
    * Correctly handle tables and paragraphs in lists. Before if there was a
      table in a list it would break the list into two halves, the half before
      the table and the half after the table (with the table inbetween them). Now
      if there is a table or paragraph in a list those elements get rolled into
      the list.
