        -----
        
        Quickstart
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This will initiate or sync an existing backup of all picasa web albumns
        for this user, into ``/target/of/backup``
        
        ::
        
            backasa -e your@gmail.com -p password1 -t /target/of/backup/ backup
        
        Full Cycle
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        1. **Setup** - Setup backup directory and store your credentials

               mkdir backup-target
               cd backup-target
               backasa setup

           -  Manually provide account email on the command line
        
        -  ``--password`` or ``-p``
        
           -  Manually provide password on the command line

           -  includes job log

        Authorization:
        --------------
        
        Backasa handles user authentication one of two ways, specified as
        command-line arguments (``--email`` and ``--password``), or via a
        ``.config`` file in the backup directory generated by the ``setup``
        action. This ``.config`` file is stored with the same level of security
        as your private ssh keys.
        
        Manual Garbage Collection
        -------------------------
        
        By default Backasa does not delete files. As new file versions come in
        older versions are marked as ``.old`` and are left on the file system
        along side their newer counterparts. Files deleted from picasa are left
        as is in your backups. The ``cleanup`` action is used to remove old
        versions of files and scan picasa for deleted files to remove from your
        file system.
