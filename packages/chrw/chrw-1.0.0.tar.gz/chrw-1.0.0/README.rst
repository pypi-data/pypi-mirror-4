chrw
====

.. _docs: http://chrw.rtfd.org

An MIT licensed, python wrapper for the `chr <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chr>`_ url shortener API.

This depends on the requests module, but that's easily installed.

Includes rate limiting (with exceptions!), and currently supports chr APIv1.

It's fairly simple, but you can read the `docs`_ online.

Installation
------------

Since it's on PyPi, you can simply ``pip install chrw``, or if you really have to, ``easy_install chrw``.

Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.
