**vadm** is a simple svn-like command line tool tool for 
freely versioning unix system files and directories including 
tracking of POSIX ownership and permission information.  
vadm is released under the terms of the GPL Version 3. 

For a quick getting started, please consult doc/install.txt.

The initial "vadm" idea was conceived and implemented
by Jens Uwe Mager (jum at anubis han de) and Holger Krekel
and used mainly on the codespeak.net site.
