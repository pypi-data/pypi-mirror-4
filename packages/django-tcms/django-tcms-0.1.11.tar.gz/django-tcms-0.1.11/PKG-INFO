        Description
        -----------
        
        Sites with custom CMS systems usually relies on deployment to bring new pages
        layouts, and these new pages are created by us, developers. tCMS_ brings a new
        mechanism where new pages definitions can be defined using our favorite tool,
        python_. With a set of building blocks pages are created easily once it's
        structure is well defined.

        ------------
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        This application only depends on django-admin.
        
        
        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        From pypi_::
        
            $ pip install django-tcms
        
        or::
        
            $ easy_install django-tcms
        
        or clone from github_::
        
            $ git clone git://github.com/omab/django-tcms.git
        
        and add tCMS_ to PYTHONPATH::
        
            $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/tcms/
        
        or::
        
            $ cd tcms
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        -------------
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        - Add tCMS_ to installed applications::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'tcms',
            )
        
        - Define where your pages are defined::
        
            TCMS_PAGES = 'tcms_pages'
        
          The application will import the modules inside and inspect anything that
          has a ``PAGE`` variable defined.
        
        - Define where images should be uploaded::
        
            TCMS_IMAGES_UPLOAD_TO = 'cms/image/%Y/%m/%d'
        
          This setting is used to populate a ``upload_to`` Django field parameter, so
          you can use any supported formats.
        
        - Define this setting if you have CKEditor_ installed and want it to be used
          while editing content::
        
            TCMS_CKEDITOR_BASE_URL = '/media/js/ckeditor'
        
        - The application uses Django cache to store content to speed up loading the
          content when serving the content to users, by default the cache name is
          ``tcms``, but you can override it by defining::
        
            TCMS_CACHE_NAME = '...'
        
        - To enable page localizations, set this setting to ``True``::
        
            TCMS_LOCALIZED = True
        
          Localization is disabled by default.
        
        - Define your settings with the extra name/values needed by your templates::
        
            RENDER_EXTRA_CONTEXT = {...}
        
        
        ------------
        Localization
        ------------
        
        If your site support multiple languages, you will want to create pages on every
        language.
        
        tCMS_ uses Django LANGUAGES when searching for supported languages, but allows
        you to create global language pages, for example if you support ``en-gb`` and
        ``en-us`` locales, it's possible to define a page with locale ``en`` and it
        will be used to server the same content for users requesting for one or other
        locale.
