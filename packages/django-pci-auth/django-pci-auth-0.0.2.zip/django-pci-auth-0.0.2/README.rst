django-pci-auth
===============

**Django 1.4+ only**

This application integrates the current Django "best of" PCI auth libraries into a single application, then fills in the gaps. Filling gaps may involve making additional decisions for you, as suggested by Django Documentation e.g.:

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#using-bcrypt-with-django
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/#increasing-the-work-factor
- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/http/sessions/#session-cookie-age

Or in some cases, additional functionality may be provided by this package e.g.:

- **XXX Add example**

Features
--------

**XXX Done**

- Stronger password hashing that allows for selection of hashing algorithm scrypt, bcrypt, PBKDF2, etc. via settings.py. [1]
- Checking for strong passwords with a default length setting overrideable in settings.py. [2]
- Integrate strong passwords into Django Admin.
- Lock out account for n minutes after x failed log-in attempts. [3]
- Set inactivity timeouts.

**XXX Not done**

- Set flags disallowing certain accounts to be locked out.
- Generate event/email when lock-out occurs.
- Log every log-on and explicit log-out (not necessary timed out log-ins).

  - **XXX I assume these need to persist beyond a restart**

- Track last four passwords and do not allow re-use.

  - **XXX I assume these need to persist beyond a restart**

- Provide JavaScript to check for strong passwords inline.

  - **XXX I assume the javascript code should check the Django settings via AJAX re: password length min/max, etc.**

- Force password reset after X amount of time.

  - **XXX I assume these need to persist beyond a restart**

Background
----------

PCI is complex. Here is a bit of background on the subject. Inasmuch as it's possible to summarize here.

Levels
~~~~~~

**XXX Do we need to worry about levels?**

- PCI Compliance Level 1 - Merchants processing over 6 million Visa transactions annually (all channels) or Global merchants identified as Level 1 by any Visa region
- PCI Compliance Level 2 - Merchants processing 1 million to 6 million Visa transactions annually (all channels)
- PCI Compliance Level 3 - Merchants processing 20,000 to 1 million Visa e-commerce transactions annually
- PCI Compliance Level 4 - Merchants processing less than 20,000 Visa e-commerce transactions annually and all other merchants processing up to 1 million Visa transactions annually

Stronger password hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a built-in feature in Django 1.4+. Documented here for convenience::

    PASSWORD_HASHERS = (
        # From https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/auth/:
        # "[redacted] This means that Django will use the first hash in the list
        # to store all passwords, but will support checking passwords stored with
        # the rest of the hashes in the list. If you remove a hash from the list
        # it will no longer be supported.
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2SHA1PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptPasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.SHA1PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.MD5PasswordHasher',
        'django.contrib.auth.hashers.CryptPasswordHasher',
