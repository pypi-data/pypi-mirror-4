        ============
        
        Fabistrano is a set of [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.6/) tasks that allows you to do [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano) style deployments for python web apps.
        
        ## What is a _capistrano style_ deployments?
        
        Capistrano deploys code under versioned directories and then symlinks the latest one as the *current* release.
        
        A sample structure would look like this:
        
          ```
            app.com
            |
            | - releases
              | - 1366924759
              | - 1366927898
              | - 1367155641
            | - shared
            | - current
          ```
        
        ## Why use this stlye of deployment?
        
        Using fabistrano you get the following benefits:
        
        - Scripted and ordered deployments
        - Very low downtime when deploying new code
        - Easy roll backs
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Install fabistrano:
        
        ` pip install fabistrano `
        
        2. In your `fabfile.py` you need to import fabistrano and set the environment variables:
        
          ```
            from fabistrano import deploy
        
            
            env.hosts = ["HOST"] # Replace with your host name or IP
            env.base_dir = '/www' # Set to your apps directory
            env.app_name = 'app_name.com' # This will deploy the app to /www/app_name.com/
            env.git_clone = 'GIT_PATH' # Your git url
        
            env.restart_cmd = 'kill -HUP `supervisorctl pid gunicorn`' # Restart command
            # or
            # env.wsgi_path = "app_name/apache.wsgi" # Relative path to the wsgi file to be touched on restart
          ```
        
        
        3. Run `setup` to create the directory structure:
        
          ` fab deploy.setup `
        
        4. Deploy the app:
        
          ` fab deploy `
        
        5. Setup your web server to point to the `current` directory.
        
        
        And you should be good to go!
