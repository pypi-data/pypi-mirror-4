Description: ====================
        django-autohide-help
        ====================
        
        django-autohide-help is a jQuery_ plugin packaged as a Django_ app for easy
        installation. It's a plugin that allows frontend developers to hide help blocks
        generated by `crispy forms`_.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install using pip::
        
            pip install django-autohide-help
        
        After adding ``autohide_help`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, ``autohide-help.js`` will
        be avalable at ``{{ STATIC_URL }}js/autohide-help.js``.
        
        If you are using RequireJS_, you can add ``autohide-help`` to dependencies, as
        it is packages with RequireJS support.
        
        If you want to use it via a simple script tag, you can add the script tag as
        usual::
        
            <script src="{{ STATIC_URL}}js/autohide-help.js``"></script>
        
        This plugin requires jQuery (obviously).
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        Select a form (or forms), and call ``autohideHelp`` on it::
        
            $('form').autohideHelp()
        
        As user enters the fields the help block is slid out, and slid back in as user
        leaves the field.
        
        Using without crispy forms
        ==========================
        
        Crispy forms are not absolutely required. It is just convenient to use them
        since they automatically generate the help blocks.
        
        If you want to use django-autohide-help without the crispy forms, make sure
        that your help blocks have an id in the following format: ``help_FIELD_ID``
        where ``FIELD_ID`` is the id of the field to which the help block belongs. For
        example, if you field has an id of ``id_name``, the help block must have the
        id of ``help_id_name``. Future releases of ``django-authide-help`` may make
        this configurable.
