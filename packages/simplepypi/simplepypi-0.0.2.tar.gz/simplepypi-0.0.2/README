This is a really, really, simple HTTP PyPI-like server.

It is intended to be used for companies or organizations that need a private
PyPi.

It literally supports four functions:

    - Allows uploading of packages
    - Downloading by package (or package and version)
    - A / page that is navigatable with a web browser
    - /pypi/ listing

It does not support:

    - Stopping you from overwriting a package with the same name / version
    - Registering packages
    - Any sort of ACLs

To use it run "simplepypi". You can upload packages by:

    - Modify your ~/.pypirc so it looks like:

        [distutils]
        index-servers =
            pypi
            local

        [local]
        username: <whatever>
        password: <doesn't matter, see above>
        repository: http://127.0.0.1:8000

        [pypi]
        ...

    - Running this on the setup.py of your favorite package:

        python setup.py sdist upload -r local

    - Then, when you want to install packages from it you do:

        pip install -i http://127.0.0.1:8000/pypi <your favorite package>

And that's it!
