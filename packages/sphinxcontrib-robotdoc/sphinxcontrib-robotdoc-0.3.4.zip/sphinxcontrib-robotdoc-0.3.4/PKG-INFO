Description: Introduction
        ------------
        
        This package provides a new Sphinx extension to embed Robot Framework test
        cases and and user keywords into Sphinx documents.
        
        The extension is not a much past *proof-of-concept* yet. Rendering of generated
        documentation may still change in the future, but API should remain backwards
        compatible.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Add ``sphinxcontrib_robotdoc`` into the extensions list of your Sphinx
        configuration (``conf.py``)::
        
            extensions = [
                "sphinxcontrib_robotdoc",
            ]
        
        Embed test cases and user keywords into your documentation with the
        following custom Docutils-directives::
        
            .. robot_tests:: Test case title or RegExp.*
               :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
               :tags: bugs, new
        
            .. robot_keywords:: Keyword title or RegExp.*
               :source: ../src/my_package/tests/acceptance/my_suite.txt
        
        Both directives (``robot_tests`` and ``robot_keywords``) take a regular
        expression as their main option (or *content* in Docutils' terms) to filter
        the embeded test cases or keywords found from the given ``source``-file. If
        no regular expression is given, all found tests or keywords will be embedded
        (like having ``.*`` as the default).
        
        Path given to the mandatory ``source``-option must be a relative path from
        the current document. (There's no support for package module paths yet.)
        
        The test case directive (``robot_tests``) accepts also an option ``tags``,
        which is optional. It should inclue a comma separated list of the tags to be
        used when filtering the tests to be embedded.
        
        *Please, note that he documentation found from the embedded test is parsed
        using Docutils, as a part of the target document. This differs from `Robot
        Framework`_'s own documentation tools, which expect a custom markup.*
