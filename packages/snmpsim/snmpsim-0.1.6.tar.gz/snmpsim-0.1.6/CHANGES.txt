0.1.6
-----

- Net-SNMP's .snmpwalk files created with the "snmpwalk -ObentU" command
  can now be used by the Simulator directly.
- SimpleAgentPro's .sapwalk files support added to Simulator.
- Fixes to --start-oid & --stop-oid params to make the working again.
- Simulator reports supported device files types on startup.
- Shared device files now supported. Snapshots can now be indicated
  as shared through a symbolic link. Managers can use different
  credentials to access and modify the same set of Managed Objects.
  
0.1.5
-----

- Simulator device file selection by a combination of ContextName,
  Transport ID and source address implemented.
- Rudimentary MIB write support added (snmpset now works). Still need to
  support MIB-defined constraints.
- Fix to snmpsimd.py to ignore possibly missing .dbm file on failed
  index rebuild.
- Fix to OID search code what used to always pick the first OID in file
  while looking for EOL (Python3 only).

0.1.4
-----

- Simulator device file selection by a combination of Community,
  Transport ID and source address implemented (for --v2c-arch mode).
- UDP/IPv6 and UNIX domain socket transports support added to
  snmpsimd.py and snmprec.py tools.
- The snmpsimd.py and snmprec.py tools now support additional SNMPv3 
  authentication (SHA) and encryption (3DES, AES192, AES256) algorithms
  provided by pysnmp.
- Simulator now supports binding to and listening at multiple local
  endpoints. The --agent-address & --agent-port options are now obsolete.
- The snmprec.py tool Agent address specification syntax unified with that
  of snmpsimd.py.
- Multiple --device-dir c/l options are now supported by snmpsimd.py.
- Some runtime diagnostics added to snmprec.py.
- The snmpsimd.py tool unconditionally rebuilds existing indices of
  unknown format.
- Device files handling indexing made faster by not calling <fileobj>.tell().
  That also required opening files in 'binary' mode to make sure offset
  calculation will work correctly.
- Attempt to open DBM in "fast" and "unsync" modes when building indices
  to speed-up index generation.
- Package meta information updated.
- Fix to snmprec.py to make SNMP debugging working again.
- Fix to snmprec.py to properly support non-default SNMP context name.
- Fix to infinite loop possibly occurring at OID search routine.
- Fix to DBM key type (string vs byte issue)
- Fix to mib2dev.py MIB path handling.
- Fix to index object to make "snmpwalk -c index" work again.
- Fix to index object registration in --v2c-arch mode.
- Fix to SNMPv2 exception objects translation into SNMPv1 PDU in the
  --v2c-arch mode

0.1.3
-----

- Initial revision of the mib2dev.py tool.
- Some more MIB-originated device files added.

0.1.2
-----

- Some more py2k refactoring (some features did not work otherwise).
- Fix to values tags matching at snmpsimd.py (simulator did not work
  otherwise).
- Fixes to sys.exc_info invocation.

0.1.1
-----

- Major overhawl for Python 2.4 -- 3.2 compatibility:
  + drop explicit long integer type use
  + map()/filter() replaced with list comprehension
  + apply() replaced with */**args
  + dictionary operations made 2K/3K compatible
  + division operator made 2K/3K compatible
  + exception syntax made 2K/3K compatible
  + tuple function arguments resolved to scalars to become py3k compatible

0.0.11
------

- --agent-port handling bug fixed in snmprec.py

0.0.10
------

- --v3-arch command-line flag added to save on large number of
  [expensive] addV1System() calls.
- setuptools dependencies improved

0.0.9
-----

- Simulator now builds a table of loaded device files in a
  dedicated 'index' context.
- Use OS-specific file extension separator for better portability.
- Support .db extensions voluntarily added by gdbm on OS X.
- Fix to null-typed value read from .dump device file.
- Legacy SNMPv1/v2c community string generation policy dropped.
- SNMPv3 VACM initialization dropped altogether, as the specialized
  SMI backend used by Simulator does not implement access control.
- Fix to support zero-length device files.
- Ignore value syntax errors in device files occured when responding.
- Optionally validate device file data while indexing.
- Allow forced device files re-indexing.
- Fix to broken IP address serialization code in recorder.

0.0.8
-----

- Initial public release.
