v0.2.2 -- 2013-02-04
  - Fixed a bug where templates and other content placed relative from the pagemaker could not be loaded if the router had been started with a working directory other than root (the default) for standalone projects.

v0.2.1 -- 2013-02-01
  - Fixed a bug with the `uweb` application where the init command would fail due to path problems. Initializing a project now works by calling `uweb init project` and can then immediately be started by calling `uweb start project`.

v0.2 -- 2013-01-31
  - Added a setup script (`uweb`) that allows easy management of standalone development servers.
  - Updated libraries for MySQL database interfacing, significant performance increases
  - Added test-suite for uWeb database model
  - Loading foreign relations for VersionedRecord fields now uses FromIdentifier (as opposed to FromPrimary), so that the most recent version of the record is loaded.

v0.1.alpha2 -- 2012-08-06
  Includes a new version of the database abstraction layer, template parser, and
  includes all data sources for included demo/test projects.

v0.1.alpha1 -- 2012-06-25
  Initial release for Underdark's uWeb package.
