<h1>Pre-Release stack tests on Hudson</h1>
<p>Use this form to create Hudson jobs that verify if one or more
  stacks are ready to be released.  To release multiple stacks that
  depend on each others changes, you need to trigger one single
  prerelease build for all stacks at once. 

<p> <img src="search.png" alt="Search for bugs" />


<h3>What gets tested:</h3>
<p>Hudson will build your stack plus all released stacks that have a
dependency on your stack. So you will find out if your own stack
works, and if the release of your stack breaks any of the already
released stacks. The build will happen on all the distributions and
architectures that are supported by Willow Garage. 

Hudson will download the branches of your stack that are specified in
the rosdistro file.  In some cases this is trunk, in other cases this
is another branch. Check the rosdistro file to see which branches will
get
tested. See <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/regression_tests">this
page</a> for more details.

<h3>Why run these tests:</h3>
<p>You should see these Hudson tests as a powerful tool to help you to
avoid the embarasment of releasing a broken stack, or worse, from
releasing a stack that breaks other people's code.  While it is
acceptable to release a stack that does not work on all distributions
and architectures that are supported by Willow Garage, your stack will
be much more useful to the community when it works on all supported
platforms.


<h3>Reproduce test results:</h3>
<p>If you're trying to reproduce a failure that only happens on a
distro/arch that is different from your machine, you can
follow <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/regression_tests/reproducing">these instructions</a> to set up a chroot invironment.

<h3>Problems:</h3>
<p>If you have any problems with the pre-release tests, you can file a
  ticket <a href="https://code.ros.org/trac/ros/newticket?component=ros_release&type=defect&owner=wim&keywords=prerelease"
