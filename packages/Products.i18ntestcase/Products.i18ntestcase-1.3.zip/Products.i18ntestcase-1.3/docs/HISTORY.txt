1.2 (2008-01-01)
----------------

- Moved to a real package layout.

  [hannosch]

- Added &reg; to the allowed HTML entities and removed &trade;.
  [hannosch]

1.1 (2005-11-20)
----------------

- Finally made running tests via 'zopectl test' work.
  [hannosch]

- Got rid of the last external binary dependency. Provided much nicer error
  messages for missing or additional messages in comparision of pot and po
  files. At least on Windows this results in a major speed improvement
  (16 sec now, 150 sec before)!
  [hannosch]

1.0 (2005-10-05)
----------------

- Lower-cased package name, to conform to Zope3/Python style
  [hannosch]

- Fixed an issue with getPoFiles not being strict enough on product
  matching, resulting in plonelanguagetool po's found for the plone product
  [hannosch]

- Move to new default comments (#. Default: "") instead of old original
  comments (# Original: "").
  [hannosch]

- Adopted syntax for i18ndude 2.0. From this point forward i18ndude 1.x
  is not supported anymore.
  [hannosch]

- Optimized slightly for speed (approx. 5% faster)
  [hannosch]

0.2 (2005-09-03)
----------------

- Got rid of a bunch of external binary dependencies by replacing the 
  testNoDuplicateMsgId() test by the Python-only version taken from CPS.
  [hannosch]

- Reordered the "if __name__ == '__main__':" magic calls in a way that
  calling the test_i18n.py script directly also works.
  [hannosch]

0.1 (2005-08-28)
----------------

- Tagged and released v0.1
  [hannosch]
