Description: TcxParser
        =========
        
        TcxParser is a minimal parser for Garmin's TCX file format. It is not
        in any way exhaustive. It simply extracts enough data to allow me to
        post data from my Garmin ForeRunner 410 watch to DailyMile's API.
        
        Data extracted:
         - latitude & longitude of start point of workout
         - type of workout (running, walking, etc)
         - time of completion of workout (in ISO UTC)
         - distance of workout (in meters)
         - duration of workout (in seconds)
         - calories burned during workout (as estimated by device)
