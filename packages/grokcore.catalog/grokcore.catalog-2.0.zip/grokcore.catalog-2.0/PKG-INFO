        What is grok?
        =============
        
        Grok is a smashing web framework based on `Zope Toolkit`_ technology.
        
        .. _`Zope Toolkit`: http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit
        
        Grok uses the Component Architecture and builds on Zope concepts like
        content objects (models), views, and adapters.  Its simplicity lies in
        using **convention over configuration** and **sensible defaults** when
        wiring components together.  That means neither a configuration
        language like ZCML nor a lot of repetition are needed to create a web
        application with grok.
        
        You can find out much more about Grok at our http://grok.zope.org
        website.
        
        Who is grok?
        ============
        
        Grok is a friendly caveman from the Stone Age.  He has a big club that
        he hunts mammoths with.  He will also use this club to smash anything
        he doesn't like.
        
        "ME GROK SMASH ZCML!"
        
        Getting grok
        ============
        
        The easiest way to get started with grok is to install the
        `grokproject <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/grokproject>`_ package
        (e.g. via ``easy_install grokproject``) and then create a new project
        area by calling the ``grokproject`` script like so::
        
          $ grokproject MyProject
          ... many lines of output here
        
        This will create a project area in ``MyProject`` as well as download
        and install grok.
        
        You can also get grok from the subversion repository::
        
          svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/grok/trunk grok
        
        Then follow the instructions of ``INSTALL.txt``.
        
        CHANGES
        *******
        
        2.0 (2013-05-07)
        ================
        
        - Rename IIndexDefinition and IndexDefinition into IAttributeIndexDefinition
          and AtributeIndexDefinition respectively. This is used for the current
          index "classes" and allow for setup() magic for attribute indexes when
          creating new catalogs.
        
          This allows for IIndexDefinition and IndexDefinition to be used for
          simpler catalog index definitions where no Grok magic is applied when
          creating catalogs.
        
        1.0 (2012-05-01)
        ================
        
        * Initial fork from Grok.
