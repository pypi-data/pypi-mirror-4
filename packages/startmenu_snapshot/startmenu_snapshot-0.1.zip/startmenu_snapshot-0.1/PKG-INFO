Description: This script recreates the winxp startmenu from the directory contents of 'All users'/startmenu
        and $userprofile$/startmenu. It can save the structure and the program icons to a pickled file
        and later reload from the file. So this is mostly useful for remembering which programs that
        you had installed on another computer and how your start menu looked.
