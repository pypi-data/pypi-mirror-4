js.ngupload
===========

Introduction
------------

This library packages `ngUpload`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`ngUpload`: http://twilson63.github.com/ngUpload/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.ngupload``) are published to some URL.
