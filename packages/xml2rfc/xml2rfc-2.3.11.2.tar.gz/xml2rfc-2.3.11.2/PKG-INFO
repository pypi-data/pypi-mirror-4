Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the DTD given in RFC2629_ (or it's `inofficial successor`_).
        
        The current incarnation of **xml2rfc** provides output in the following
        formats: Paginated and unpaginated ascii text, html, nroff, and expanded xml.
        Only the paginated text format is currently (January 2013) accepable as draft
        submissions to the IETF.

        Installation
        ============
        
        System Install
        --------------
        
        To install a system-wide version of xml2rfc, download and unpack the `xml2rfc 
        distribution package`_, then cd into the resulting package directory and run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Alternatively, if you have the 'pip_' command ('Pip Installs Packages') installed,
        you can run pip to download and install the package::
        
            $ pip install xml2rfc
        
        .. _lxml:				http://lxml.de/
        .. _pip:				http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        .. _xml2rfc distribution package:	http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
        
        
        
        User Install
        ------------
        
        If you want to perform a local installation for a specific user,
        you have a couple of options.  You may use python's default location
        of user site-packages by specifying the flag ``--user``.  These locations are:
        
            * UNIX: $HOME/.local/lib/python<ver>/site-packages
            * OSX: $HOME/Library/Python/<ver>/lib/python/site-packages
            * Windows: %APPDATA%/Python/Python<ver>/site-packages
        
        You can additionally combine the flag ``--install-scripts`` with ``--user`` to
        specify a directory on your PATH to install the xml2rfc executable to.  For
        example, the following command::
        
            $ python setup.py install --user --install-scripts=$HOME/bin
        
        will install the xml2rfc library and data to your local site-packages
        directory, and an executable python script ``xml2rfc`` to $HOME/bin.
        
        Custom Install
        --------------
        
        The option ``--prefix`` allows you to specify the base path for all
        installation files.  The setup.py script will exit with an error if your
        PYTHONPATH is not correctly configured to contain the library path
        the script tries to install to.
        
        The command is used as follows::
        
            $ python setup.py install --prefix=<path>
        
        For further fine-tuning of the installation behavior, you can get a list
        of all available options by running::
        
            $ python setup.py install --help
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        **Options**
            The following parameters affect how xml2rfc behaves, however none are required.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.3.11.2 (18 Jan 2013)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Tweaked the install_required setting in setup.py to not pull down lxml 3.x
            (as it's not been tested with xml2rfc) and bumped the version.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.3.11 (18 Jan 2013)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release fixes all outstanding major bugs, details below.
          The issue tracker is at http://tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/.
        
          * Updated the nroff writer to do backslash escaping on source text, to 
            avoid escaping nroff control characters.  Fixes issue #77.
        
          * Added a modified xref writer to the nroff output writer, in order to 
            handle xref targets which should not be broken across lines.  This, 
            together with changeset [688], fixes issue #80.
        
          * Added text to the section test case to trigger the second part of issue 
            #79.  It turns out that the changes in [688] fixed this, too; this closes 
            issue #79.
        
          * Tweaked the nroff generation to not break on hyphens, in order to avoid 
            hyphenated words ending up with embedded spaces: 'pre-processing' becoming 
            'pre- processing' if 'pre-' occurred at the end of an nroff text line.  
            Also tweaked the line-width used in line-breaking to have matching 
            line-breaks between .txt and .nroff output (with exception for lines ending 
            in hyphens).
        
          * Tweaked roman number list counter to output roman numbers in a field 5 
            spaces wide, instead of having varied widths.  This is different from 
            version 1, so may have to be reverted, depending on how people react.
        
          * Added a warning for too long lines in figures and tables.  No 
            outdenting for now; I'd like to consult some about that. Fixes issue #76.
        
          * Updated tests showing that all list format specifiers mentioned in 
            issue #70 now works.  Closes isssue #70.
        
          * Changed spanx emphasis back to _this_ instead of -this-, matching the v1 
            behaviour.  Addresses issue #70.
        
          * Make <vspace/> in a hangindent list reset the indentation to the 
            hang-indent, even if the bullet text is longer than the hang-indent.  
            Addresses issue #70.
        
          * Refined the page-breaking to not insert an extra page break for artwork
            that won't fit on a page anyway.
        
          * Refined the page-breaking to avoid breaking artwork and tables across 
            pages, if possible.
        
          * Fixed a problem with centering of titles and labels.  Fixes issue #73.
        
          * Changed the leading and trailing whitespace lines of a page to better 
            match legacy output.  Fixed the autobreaking algorithm to correctly avoid 
            orphans and widows; fixes issue #72.  Removed an extra blank line at the 
            top of the page following an early page break to avoid orphan or widow.
        
          * Tweaked the generation of ToC dot-lines and page numbers to better 
            match legacy xml2rfc.  Fixed a bug in the generation of xref text where 
            trailing whitespace could cause double spaces.  Tweaked the output format 
            to produce the correct number of leading blank lines on the first page of a 
            document.
        
          * Modified the handling of figure titles, so that given titles will be 
            written also without anchor or figure counting.  Fixes issue #75.
        
          * Tweaked the html writer to have a buffer interface that provides a 
            self.buf similar to the other writers, for test purposes.
        
          * Reworked the WriterElementTest suite to test all the output formats, 
            not only paginated text.
        
          * Added a note about /usr/local/bin permissions.  This closes issue #65.
        
          * Added files describing possible install methods (INSTALL), and possible 
            build commands (Makefile).
        
          * The syntax that was used to specify the version of the lxml dependency 
            ('>=') is not supported in python distutil setup.py files, and caused setup 
            to try to find an lxml version greater than =2.2.8, which couldn't succeed. 
            Fixed to say '>2.2.7' instead.  This was probably the cause of always 
            reinstalling lxml even when it was present.
        
          * Updated README.rst to cover the new --date option, and tweaked it a bit.
        
          * Added some files to provide an enhanced source distribution package.
        
          * Updated setup.py with maintainer and licence information.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.3.10 (03 Jan 2013)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Changed the output text for Internet-Draft references to omit the 
            series name, but add (work in progress).  Updated the test case to match 
            draft revision number.
        
          * Updated all the rfc editor boilerplate in valid test facits to match the 
            correct outcome (which is also what the code actually produces).
        
          * Changed the diff test error message so that the valid text is output as 
            the original, not as the changed text of a diff.
        
          * Corrected test cases to match correct expiry using 185 days instead of 
            183 days from document date.
        
          * Added missing attributes to the XmlRfcError Exception subclass, 
            necessary in order to make it resemble lxml's error class and provide 
            consistent error messages to the user whether they come from lxml or our 
            own code.
        
          * Added a licence file, indicating the licencing used by the IETF for the 
            xml2rfc code.
        
          * Fixed up the xml2rfc cli script to provide better help texts by telling 
            the option parser the appropriate option variable names.
        
          * Fixed up the help text formatting by explicitly providing an appropriate
            help text formatter to the option parser.  
        
          * Added an option (--date=DATE)to provide the document date on the command
            line.
        
          * Added an option (--no-dtd) to disable the DTD validation step.  
        
          * Added code to catch additional exceptions and provide appropriate user
            information, instead of an exception traceback.
