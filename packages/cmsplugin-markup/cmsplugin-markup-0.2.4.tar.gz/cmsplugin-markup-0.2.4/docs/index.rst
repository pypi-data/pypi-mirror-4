cmsplugin-markup's documentation
================================

An extendable markup content plugin for `Django CMS`_. It allows you to use
various markup languages for content. It is extendable through its own markup
plugin system so additional markup languages can be supported. By default it
supports Markdown_, reST_ and Textile_ markup languages.

Installation
------------

You should install it somewhere Django can find it and add ``cmsplugin_markup``
to ``INSTALLED_APPS``. You can also configure ``CMS_MARKUP_OPTIONS`` setting to
configure which markup plugins you want available in Django CMS.

To install it from PyPi_ run::

    pip install cmsplugin-markup

To install it from source code run::

    python setup.py install

If you want preview functionality in admin to work you have to add something
like the following to your ``urls.py`` file::

    (r'^admin/cms/plugin/markup/', include('cmsplugin_markup.urls')),

This will also allow markup plugins to handle their own additional URLs under
above base URL.

If you need support for some other markup language, you can extend this plugin
through its own :ref:`markup plugin API <markup plugin API>`.

For example, there exists a plugin_ for Trac_ wiki engine with powerful markup
language (with its own macros and plugins).
