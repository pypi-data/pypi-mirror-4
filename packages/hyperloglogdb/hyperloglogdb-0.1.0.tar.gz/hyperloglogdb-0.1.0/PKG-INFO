Description: # HyperLogLogDB
        
        A disk-backed in-memory database of HyperLogLog data structures for estimating
        cardinality of many distinct sets. It uses memory mapped files to keep
        recently used data in memory and let's the OS layer sync data between disk
        and memory as space allows. A
        [HyperLogLog](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.9475)
        is a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm. I built this key-value
        style database to facilitate a need we have at [pubnub](http://pubnub.com)
        for tracking continuously growing sets for each customer for each granular
        period of time. HyperLogLog's ability to add values and estimate in
        cardinality in constant time and memory is essential. Sparse data sets also
        compress quite well.
        
        This library contains a modified version of the HyperLogLog implementation
        by Vasiliy Evseenko: <https://github.com/svpcom/hyperloglog>

         * [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) is used for efficient merging of sets
        
        ## Examples
        
        ```pycon
        >>> import hyperloglogdb
        >>>
        >>> my_hlldb = hyperloglogdb.HyperLogLogDB(file_path='my_hlldb.db', error_rate=0.01)
        >>>
        >>> # or:
        >>> f = open('my_hlldb.db', 'r+b')
        >>> my_hlldb = hyperloglogdb.HyperLogLogDB(fileobj=f, error_rate=0.01)
        >>>
        >>> # Add 'test_val' to the set stored at key 'test_key'
        >>> my_hlldb.add('test_key', 'test_val')
        >>> print my_hlldb.count('test_key')
        1
        >>> print len(my_hlldb.get_hll('test_key'))
        1
        >>> my_hlldb.flush()
        >>> # you can now copy or compress my_hlldb.db and open it at a later time
        >>>
        >>> my_hlldb2 = hyperloglogdb.HyperLogLogDB(file_path='my_hlldb2.db', error_rate=0.01)
        >>> my_hlldb2.add('test_key', 'test_val2')
        >>> my_hlldb.merge(my_hlldb2)
        >>> print my_hlldb.count('test_key')
        2

        ### _class_ `hyperloglogdb.MmapSlice`( _mmap_file_, _length_, _offset=0_ )
        
        A module abstracting a slice of a larger memory mapped file (python `mmap`)
        
         * **mmap_file** - the `mmap` file object
         * **length** - length in bytes of this slice
         * **offset** - offset in bytes from the start of the _mmap_file_
        
        > #### count( _val_ )
        > Returns the number of occurrences of val in the slice
        >
        > * **val** - a byte to search for
        
        ### _class_ `hyperloglogdb.HyperLogLog`( _error_rate_, _data_, _bitcount_arr=None_ )
        
        A single instance of a HyperLogLog data structure
        
         * **error_rate** - ( _float_ ) the approx. percentage error rate. This determines the size of the data.
         * **data** - ( _MmapSlice_ ) the data slice where this hyper log log should be stored
         * **bitcount_arr** - ( _list_ ) optionally include a pre-generated bitcount array so it doesn't need to be regenerated for each HLL in the DB.
        
        > #### add( _val_ )
        > Adds a single value to the set
        >
        > * **val** - ( _string_ ) to add to the set
        
        
        > #### update( _others_ )
        > Merges either a single `HyperLogLog` or a list of `HyperLogLog`s into the current data structure
        >
        > * **others** - ( _HyperLogLog_ or _list of HyperLogLogs_ ) to merge into the set
        
        > #### length()
        >
        > Returns the estimated cardinality of the set
        
        
        ### _class_ `hyperloglogdb.HyperLogLogDB`( _file_path=None_, _fileobj=None_, _error_rate=0.01_ )
        
        A disk-backed key-value stores of `HyperLogLog` data structures
        
         * **file_path** - ( _string_ ) a relative path to the location of the file storing the data. If the file does not exist it will be created. Either _file_path_ or _fileobj_ must be provided.
         * **fileobj** - ( _file_ object ) a file object containing the file for storing data. Either _file_path_ or _fileobj_ must be provided.
         * **error_rate** - ( _float_ ) the approx. percentage error rate. This determines the size of each `HyperLogLog`.

        > Syncs any in-memory updates to disk
        
        > #### create( _key_ )
        > Creates an empty `HyperLogLog` data structure and returns it.
        >
        > * **key** - ( _string_ ) the key that the HyperLogLog is associated with

        > Merges either a single `HyperLogLogDB` or a list of `HyperLogLogDB`s into the current database. If a key in _others_ does not exist in the current structure it will be created.
