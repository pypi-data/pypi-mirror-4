put-pipeline-definition
***********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Adds tasks, schedules, and preconditions that control the behavior of
the pipeline. You can use put-pipeline-definition to populate a new
pipeline or to update an existing pipeline that has not yet been
activated.

put-pipeline-definition also validates the configuration as it adds it
to the pipeline. Changes to the pipeline are saved unless one of the
following three validation errors exists in the pipeline. * An object
is missing a name or identifier field. * A string or reference field
is empty. * The number of objects in the pipeline exceeds the maximum
allowed objects.

Pipeline object definitions are passed to the put-pipeline-definition
action and returned by the  get-pipeline-definition action.

"--pipeline-objects"  (list)
   The objects that define the pipeline. These will overwrite the
   existing pipeline definition.

      (structure)
         Contains information about a pipeline object. This can be a
         logical, physical, or physical attempt pipeline object. The

                  pipeline object. The value is specified as either a
                  string value (StringValue) or a reference to another
                  object (RefValue) but not as both.

                  "string_value"  (string)
                     The field value, expressed as a String.

                  "ref_value"  (string)
                     The field value, expressed as the identifier of
                     another object.

                  "key"  (string)
                     The field identifier.

         "id"  (string)
