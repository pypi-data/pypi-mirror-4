Running
=======

This is how you do it::

    class MyTest(TestCase):

       def test_foo(self):
         django_url = self.useFixture(DjangoFixture()).base_url
         do_stuff_to_django(django_url)


Known problems and future work
==============================

* The port of the Django service is constant, so it is difficult to use the
  fixture in parallel.

* Very minimal test coverage.  This was originally written to test something
  else.

* pkgme-service_ has ``DjangoSettings``, ``DjangoDatabase``, and
  ``CeleryFixture``.  They are all probably useful and appropriate for here.
