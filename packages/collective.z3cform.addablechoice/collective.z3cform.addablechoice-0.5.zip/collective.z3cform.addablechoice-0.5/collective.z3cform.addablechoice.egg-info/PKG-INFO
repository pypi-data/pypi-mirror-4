Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds a z3c.form widget (called an Addable Choice Widget) that provides a
        text input in which the user can enter a new value, but also a dropdown in
        which previously added values are shown.
        
        The user therefore has the choice to use a value previously given, or to give a
        new value.
        
        When this widget is used for the first time, the dropdown will of course be
        empty, as there won't be any previously added values.
        
        
        How to use:
        -----------
        
            from plone.directives import form
            from collective.z3cform.addablechoice.widget import AddableChoiceFieldWidget
        
        
            class IMyType(form.Schema):
                """ """
        
                product_name = schema.TextLine(
                        title=_(u'label_product_name', default=u'Product Name'),
                    )
                form.widget(product_name=AddableChoiceFieldWidget)
