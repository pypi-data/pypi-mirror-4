        Introduction
        ============
        
        This product add a two new criteria for dates inside Plone, someway similar to the "*Today*" ones.
        
        What you can't do with the default Plone relative criteria is configure a Collection that:
        
        * show all news published this month
        * show all file modified this year
        * ... and so on.
        
        As default Plone "today" criteria, the "this month" and "this year" values are taken automatically.
        
        How to use
        ==========
        
        The new criteria displays a simple selection between:
        
        * This year
        * This month
