Description: tiddlywebplugins.imaker is a tool to help create new instance.
        
        In TiddlyWeb, an instance is a particular store + configuration
        which serves up a set of content and features.
        
        imaker works to ensure that created instances have the expected
        initial configuration and initial bags, recipes, users and tiddlers.
        
        ibuilder replaces the installation half of the functionality 
        provided by tiddlywebplugins.instancer. See tiddlywebplugins.ibuilder
        for the other half.
