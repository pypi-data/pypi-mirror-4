Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        plone.app.discussion aims to be the new commenting system for Plone. It was 
        initially developed as part of the Google Summer of Code 2009 by Timo 
        Stollenwerk (student) and Martin Aspeli (mentor).
        
        plone.app.discussion is an add-on product for Plone 3.3.x and 4.0.x and will be
        shipped as part of Plone 4.1. 
        
        .. note::
        
          Make sure you pin down plone.app.discussion to versions < 2.0 if you want to
          install it as an add-on product (see install instructions below for more 
          details).
        
        Please report bugs to the `Plone bug tracker`_.

        - Check if the current user has configured an e-mail address for the email

        1.0RC1 (2011-01-22)

          [timo]
        
        - Fix CSS for commenter images with a width of more than 2.5em. This fixes

          [timo]

          when plone.app.discussion is installed.
          [davisagli]

          [EpeliJYU]
        
        - Assigning the 'Reply to item' permission to the 'Authenticated' role. The old
          commenting system allowed 'Authenticated' users to post comments. Also, OpenID
          users do not possess the 'Authenticated' role.
          [timo]
        
        - Make sure the handleComment method checks for the 'Reply to item' permission
          when adding a comment.
          [timo]
        
        - Make the mail-setting warning message show up in the discussion control panel.

        - Do not allow to change the mail settings in the discussion control panel, if
          there is no valid mail setup.
          [timo]
        
        - Disable all commenting options in the discussion control panel if comments
          are disabled globally.
        
        - Check for the 'review comments' permission instead of 'manage' to decide
          if the user should see a 'this comment is pending' message.
          [timo]
        
        - Move "moderate comments" site action above the logout action.

          [timo]

          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10652.
          [timo]
        
        - Fix 'check all' on batch moderation page.
          [davisagli]
        
        - Use safe_unicode to decode the title of the content. encode("utf-9") caused
          Dexterity based content types to raise a unicode decode error. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11292
          [dukebody]
        
        - Spanish translation updated.

        1.0b12 (2010-11-04)
        -------------------
        
        - Remove AJAX comment deletion binding. This function relies on the nextUntil()
          selector introduced by jQuery 1.4 and therefore breaks in Plone 3
          (that currently uses jQuery 1.3.2).
          [timo]
        
        
        1.0b11 (2010-11-03)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix Dutch and Czech language code and name.
          [timo]
        
        - Re-add the CommentsViewlet can_manage method. This method has been removed
          in version 1.0b9 and added again in 1.0b11 because we don't want to change
          the API in beta releases.
          [timo]
        
        - Declare z3c.form and zope.schema as minimum version dependencies in setup.py
          in case people use a different KGS.
          [timo]
        
        - Add and update es and eu l10ns.
          [dukebody, on behalf of erral]
        
        - Ajaxify comment deletion and approval.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - New feature: As a logged-in user, I can enable/disable email notification of
          additional comments on this content object.
          [timo]
        
        - Disable the plone.app.registry check on schema elements, so no error is
          raised on upgrades. This fixes https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11195.
          [timo]
        
        - Remove the too generic id attribute of the comment form.
          [timo]
        
        - Fixed handling of non-ascii member data, like fullname and email.
          [hannosch]
        
        
        1.0b10 (2010-10-15)
        -------------------
        
        - Fixed "global name 'WrongCaptchaCode' is not defined" if norobots captcha,
          but no other validation package is installed.
          [naro]
        
        - Check if there is a 'pending' review state in the current workflow for
          comments instead of just checking for the 'comment_review_workflow'. This
          allows integrators to use a custom review workflow. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11184.
          [timo]
        
        - fixed plone-it.po (improper language code ('en' instead of 'it'))
          [ajung]
        
        
        1.0b9 (2010-10-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Replace the can_manage method with a can_review method that checks the
          'Review comments' permission. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11145.
          [timo]
        
        - Fix moderation actions (publish, delete) in the moderation view with virtual
          hosts. This is a replacement for http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/35608.
          [timo]
        
        - Do not show two "login to add comments" buttons when there are no comments
          yet. This fixes http://plone.org/products/plone.app.discussion/issues/12.
          [timo]
        
        
        1.0b8 (2010-10-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Apply the comment viewlet template and styles to the new title-less comments.
          This might require integrators to apply their custom templates and styles.
          [timo]
        
        - Remove title field from the comment form and replace it with an auto-generated
          title ("John Doe on Welcome to Plone").
          [timo]
        
        - Fix http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11098: "Comment byline shows login
          name, not full name"
          [kiorky]
        
        - Make sure the __parent__ pointer (the conversation) of a comment is not
          acquisition wrapped in conversation.addComment. This fixes
          http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11157.
          [timo]
        
        - Revert r35608 since this was breaking the comment moderation bulk actions.
          The BulkActionsView expects the absolute path of the comments without the
          portal url (e.g. '/plone/doc1/++conversation++default/1285346769126020').
          This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11156.
          [timo]
        
        - Use "(function($) { /* some code that uses $ \*/ })(jQuery)" instead of
          "$(document).ready(function(){ /* some code that uses $ \*/ });" to invoke

          [saffe]
        
        * Store dates in utc and not in local time. Display local time
          [do3cc]
        
        * Fetch context for the comment view with "context = aq_inner(self.context)".
          [timo]
        
        * Raise an unauthorized error when authenticated users try to post a comment
          on a content object that has discussion disabled. Thanks to vincentfrentin
          for reporting this.

          for integrators to override them.
          [timo]
        
        * Plain text and intelligent text options for comment text added to preserve
          basic text structure and to make links clickable.
          [timo]
        
        * Rewrote all tal:condition in comments.pt. The authenticated user has
          the reply button and the comment form if he has the "Reply to item"
          permission And the discussion is currently allowed.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.0b6 (2010-08-24)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed the case where a folder has allow_discussion=False and
          conversation.enabled() on a document in this folder returned False
          instead of True because of allow_discussion acquisition.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * Redirect to the comment form action instead of the absolute URL when a
          comment is posted. This fixes the accidentally triggered file upload when a
          comment is posted on a file content object.
          [timo]

        * Renamed legend_add_comment to label_add_comment to have the translation from
          plone domain.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * label_comment_by and label_commented_at are not in Plone 4 translation
          anymore, so these two messages moved to plone.app.discussions i18n domain.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * Translate "Warning" shown in @@moderate-comments in the plone domain.
          [vincentfretin]

        * Catch Type errors in indexers if object can not be adapted to IDiscussion
          [do3cc]
        
        * Call the CaptchaValidator even when no captcha data was submitted. This is
          necessary to ensure that the collective.akismet validator is called when
          installed.
          [timo]
        
        * Spanish translation added. Thanks to Judith Sanleandro.

        1.0b5 (2010-07-16)
        ------------------
        
        * Use self.form instead of CommentForm for the CommentsViewlet update method so
          integrators don't have to override the viewlet's update method.
          [matous]
        
        * Make sure the form fields in the reply form are always placed under the field
          labels.
          [timo]
        
        * Fix CSS overflow bug that occurs with the new Plone 4.0b5 comment styles.

        * Avoid deprecation warning for the Globals package.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Remove the hard coded check for title and text when the comment form is
          submitted. This allows integrators to write schema extenders that remove the
          title from the comment form.
          [timo]
        
        * Move captcha registration to its own captcha.zcml file.
          [timo]

          support added.
          [timo]
        
        * Simplify the CaptchaValidator class by dynamically adapting a view with the
          name of the captcha plugin (e.g. recaptcha, captcha, akismet) for the
          validator.
          [timo]
        
        * Dutch translation added.

        * Design notes for the Captcha plugin architecture added.
          [timo]
        
        * Make IDiscussionLayer inherit from Interface again. Remove IDefaultPloneLayer,
          since Plone 4.0b1 and plone.theme 2.0b1 are out now.
          [timo]
        
        * Clean up Javascript code.
          [timo]
        
        * Fix encoding error in migration procedure, otherwise migration procedure
          breaks on joining output list in case we have there any non-ascii characters.
          [piv]
        
        * plone.z3cform 0.6.0 compatibility (fix maximum recursion depth error which
          appears with plone.z3cform higher than 0.5.10).
          [piv]
        
        * Removed moderation.js from js registry and include it only in moderation.pt as
          that is the only place where it is used.

        * Rename "Single State Workflow" to "Comment Single State Workflow".
          [timo]

        * Make p.a.d. work with the recent version of plone.z3cform (0.5.10)
          [timo]

          the conversation from the canonical object.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Play by the Plone 3.3+ rules and use the INavigationRoot as a base for the
          moderation view.

        * Added a commentTitle CSS class to the comment titles.
