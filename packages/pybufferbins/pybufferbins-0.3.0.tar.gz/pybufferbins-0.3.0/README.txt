Fast routine to seemlessly classify and store incoming data into an infinite number Protocol Buffer files ("bins"). Bins are grouped into directories by a specific field. Data can then be retrieved by the grouped-field's value. Virtually any data can be stored for fast retrieval by using a Bins instance as an index for each required configuration of data.

Origins
=======

In the process of having to read, parse, validate, classify, and store (in multiple ways) television-program scheduling data, I needed an efficient method to store the data. Here, efficiency meant fast to load, and fast to store into multiple, concurrent indices.

Example Usage
=============

Import the functionality. We're primarily interested in Bins (each instance of which will be referred to as an "index" so as to not be ambiguous between the Bins object and the bin files, themselves), but we also need to tell the Bins instance how to sort the data. We want to use the SORT_BYKEY strategy.

    from pybufferbins.bins import Bins, SORT_BYKEY

For the purpose of the example, there have been some Protocol Buffer types 
imported.

    SdProgram
    SdSchedule

To configure the index, instantiate with the name of a directory to store the bins in. You must add handlers for every type of record that will be pushed into the bins. The method also requires the name of the field on the record that will be used to group the records into bins.

    programs = Bins('sd_bins/by_program', SORT_BYKEY)

    programs.add_handler(SdProgram, 'Program')
    programs.add_handler(SdSchedule, 'Program')

Push each incoming record:

    programs.push(schedule)

You may push to any number of indices simultaneously. All indices are thread-safe.

Make sure to do a flush after all pushes are complete:

    programs.flush()

Example Scenario
================

From a home system, 5170 programs describing a day's worth of television programs, along with additional data describing stations, schedules, program-station-channel mappings, actors, and genre records, were downloaded and stored across three different bins-configurations ("indices") containing a total of 8251 bins in fourteen seconds.
