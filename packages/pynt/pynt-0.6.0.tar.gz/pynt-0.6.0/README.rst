pynt - Lightweight Python Build Tool.
=====================================

`**Raghunandan Rao** <https://github.com/rags>`_

Features
--------

-  Really quick to learn.
-  Build tasks are just python funtions.
-  Manages dependancies between tasks.
-  Automatically generates a command line interface.
-  Rake style param passing to tasks

Installation
------------

You can install pynt from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or from
source.

Using pip

::

    $ pip install pynt

Using easy\_install

::

    $ easy_install pynt

Example
-------

The build script is written in pure Python and pynt takes care of
managing any dependancies between tasks and generating a command line
interface.

Tasks are just regular Python functions marked with the ``@task()``
decorator. Dependancies are specified with ``@task()`` too. Tasks can be
ignored with the ``@ignore`` decorator.

After defining all tasks ``build(sys.modules[__name__],sys.argv[1:])``
is called to run the build.

::


    #!/usr/bin/python

    import sys
    from pynt import task, build

    @task()
    def clean():
        '''Clean build directory.'''
        print 'Cleaning build directory...'

    @task(clean)
    def html(target='.'):
        '''Generate HTML.'''
        print 'Generating HTML in directory "%s"' %  target

    @task(clean, ignore=True)
    def images():
        '''Prepare images.'''
        print 'Preparing images...'

    @task(html,images)
    def start_server(server='localhost', port = '80'):
        '''Start the server'''
        print 'Starting server at %s:%s' % (server, port)

    @task(start_server) #Depends on task with all optional params
    def stop_server():
        print 'Stopping server....'

    @task()
    def copy_file(src, dest):
        print 'Copying from %s to %s' % (src, dest)

    @task()
    def echo(*args,**kwargs):
        print args
        print kwargs
        
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        build(sys.modules[__name__],sys.argv[1:])

The command line interface and help is automatically generated. Task
descriptions are extracted from function docstrings.

::

    $ ./example.py 
    usage: example.py [-h] [-l] [task [task ...]]

    positional arguments:
      task              perform specified task and all it's dependancies

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -l, --list-tasks  List the tasks

    Tasks in build file ./example.py:
      clean                       Clean build directory.
      copy_file                   
      echo                        
      html                        Generate HTML.
      images           [Ignored]  Prepare images.
      start_server                Start the server
      stop_server

pynt takes care of dependencies between tasks. In the following case
start\_server depends on clean, html and image generation (image task is
ignored).

::

    $ ./example.py start_server
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
    Generating HTML in directory "."
    [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
    [ example.py - Ignoring task "images" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "start_server" ]
    Starting server at localhost:80
    [ example.py - Completed task "start_server" ]

The first few characters of the task name is enough to execute the task,
as long as the partial name is unambigious. You can specify multiple
tasks to run in the commandline. Again the dependencies are taken taken
care of.

::

    $ ./example.py cle ht cl
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
    Generating HTML in directory "."
    [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]

The 'html' task dependency 'clean' is run only once. But clean can be
explicitly run again later.

pynt tasks can accept parameters from commandline.

::

    $ ./example.py "copy_file[/path/to/foo, path_to_bar]"
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "copy_file" ]
    Copying from /path/to/foo to path_to_bar
    [ example.py - Completed task "copy_file" ]

pynt can also accept keyword arguments.

::

    $ ./example.py start[port=8888]
    [ example.py - Starting task "clean" ]
    Cleaning build directory...
    [ example.py - Completed task "clean" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "html" ]
    Generating HTML in directory "."
    [ example.py - Completed task "html" ]
    [ example.py - Ignoring task "images" ]
    [ example.py - Starting task "start_server" ]
    Starting server at localhost:8888
    [ example.py - Completed task "start_server" ]
        
    $ ./example.py echo[hello,world,foo=bar,blah=123]
    [ example.py - Starting task "echo" ]
    ('hello', 'world')
    {'blah': '123', 'foo': 'bar'}
    [ example.py - Completed task "echo" ]
