Description: httmock
        =======
        
        A mocking library for `requests`
        
        ------
        
        You can use it to mock third-party APIs and test libraries that use `requests` internally:
        
        ```python
        from httmock import urlmatch, HTTMock
        import requests
        
        @urlmatch(netloc=r'(.*\.)?google\.com$')
        def google_mock(url, request):
            return 'Feeling lucky, punk?'
        
        with HTTMock(google_mock):
            r = requests.get('http://google.com/')
        print r.content  # 'Feeling lucky, punk?'
        ```
