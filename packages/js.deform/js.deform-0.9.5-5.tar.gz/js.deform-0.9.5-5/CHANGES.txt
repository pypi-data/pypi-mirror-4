CHANGES
=======

0.9.5-5
-------

-   Include ``js.jquery_form`` dependency in setup.py (thanks icemac!).

0.9.5-4

-   Make all items in resource_mapping a list, so that third party
    packages (e.g. kotti_tinymce) can append resources.

0.9.5-3
-------

-   Add an includme for easy using in Pyramid projects.

-   Change patching to only patch deform.form.Form instead of individual
    widgets.

0.9.5-2
-------

-   Add ``auto_need`` method for automatically including Fanstatic resources
    for a given Deform form instance.

    event which we can subscribe to.

-   Make the CSS resources available separately as well as combined with
    the JS resource.

0.9.5
