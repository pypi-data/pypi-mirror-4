        Eventually this will be a python module to access the GitHub v3 API.
        
        This is not stable yet and there is no backwards compatibility yet. There will 
        likely be some changes which change behavior in the near future.

        Testing
        ~~~~~~~
        
        If you want to run the unittests with authentication, simply run::
        
            make alltests
        
        From the root of the repository. If you would rather see what will take place 
        on Travis, run::
        
            make travis
            # or
            make tests
        
        To test how much of the library is covered::
        
            make coverage_auth
            # equivalently
            make coverage_all
            # or without authentication
            make coverage
        
        Depending on which you run, you will see different percentages reported by 
        coverage. As of this writing (2012-10-05), ``coverage_auth`` reports 98% of 
        the library is covered and every module has coverage >= 93%.
