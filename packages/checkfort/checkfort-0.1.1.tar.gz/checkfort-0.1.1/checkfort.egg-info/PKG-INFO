Description: ==================================
        CheckFort : A wrapper for Forcheck
        ==================================
        
        CheckFort is a wrapper for `Forcheck`_, a static analyser for Fortran.
        CheckFort aims to simplify the launching of forcheck and reformats its
        output into a format which we believe to be easier to navigate.
        
        
        Dependencies:
        =============
        
        * A valid installation of FORCHECK (version >=14.2)
        * Python >=2.6
        * pygments >=1.4
        * chardet
        * jinja2
        * pexpect
        
        
        Usage:
        ======
        
        To use CheckFort, you need a valid Forcheck_ installation. The following
        environment variables must be set:
        
        * FCKDIR : Forcheck installation directory
        * FCKPWD : Path to Forcheck license file
        
        You can then run:
        
            cfort [options] files/dirs...
        
        Run `cfort --help` for more options.

        ===========
        
        CheckFort is developed independently from Forcheck and is neither endorsed
        nor supported by its provider.
