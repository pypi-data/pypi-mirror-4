=== 0.8 ===

- Added better error output when ONLINE_DOCS_DEBUG is true.

=== 0.7 ===

- Improved README.rst
- New setting: ONLINE_DOCS_DEBUG. Default is False. Set it to True to see
  what the documentation filename of the current view should be. It will be
  displayed at the end of your rendered documentation, so just click at the
  docs link.

=== 0.6 ===

- New template tag ``url_cross_reference`` allows to render links to other
  documents in the documentation that will re recognized by JavaScript and
  therefore open in the current jQuery modal.

=== 0.5 ===

- BUGFIX: When no .md template can be found for the current view, the app
  threw an exception and therefore did not display the error message.
- New dependency in requirements.txt: mock
- Removed some project specific code from online_docs.html template.

=== 0.4 ===

- CONTAINS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES!!
- Putting the .md into the /static/ folders was a stupid idea. They must now
  reside in the /templates/ folders. All you need to do is to move them from
  your apps' /static/online_docs/ folders into /templates/online_docs/ folders

- Added tox.ini

=== 0.3 ===

- Loading the .md files with the Django Template() class. This means you can
  use {% load i18n %} and use the {% trans %} and {% blocktrans %} tag to
  create multilingual docs.

=== 0.2 ===

- Many changes in README
- Reduced dependencies in requirements.txt
- Added project to travis-ci.org: http://travis-ci.org/#!/bitmazk/django-online-docs
- Added better test file at /online_docs/static/online_docs/online_docs_view.md
