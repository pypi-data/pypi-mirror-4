___________________________

Version 1.4.2 - 2012/09/04
___________________________

- Prepare for Python 3 compatibility: remove ``dict.has_key()`` usage, and 
  check integer division. Added ``from __future__ import division`` where 
  floating point division was needed.

  new years of schooling.

Version 1.4.2 - 2012/09/04
___________________________

- Fix PyPI homepage so like to pyabm homepage is working.
- Add details to docs.
- Update batch R script to handle cases where results files are missing from 
  some model run folders (due to cancelled or failed runs, for example). Rather 
  than failing, the script will now print a warning and skip each run with a 
  missing result file.
- Change sleep time in ``threaded_batch_run.py`` to 10 seconds instead of 5 to 
  allow more time for writing world files so different threads don't try to 
  write to the same files at the same time.
