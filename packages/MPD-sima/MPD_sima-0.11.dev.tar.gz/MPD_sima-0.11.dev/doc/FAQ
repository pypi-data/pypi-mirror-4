faq00: MPD_sima is lopping over the same two artist!!! (possibly more than two)

faq01: MPD_sima is queuing artists way out regarding similarity!!!
       Does not sound similar to me.

faq02: Is MPD_sima working behind a proxy?

faq03: MPD_sima is sometimes queuing twice the same title while I'm pretty sure
       the title is still in history and it shouldn't be played again.

faq00:
    Well, one reason for that is that your library is missing diversity for
    these two artists. A solution is to take advantage of the user_db which
    allows you to enhanced lats.fm replies with your own suggestions.  For
    instance running MPD_sima on my own library I often get stuck in a
    Zwan/Smashing Pumpkins loop until one or the other filled the history!
    Adding Nirvana as a suggestion for Smashing Pumpkins in user_db breaks the
    loop (provided that Nirvana is well furnish regarding similar artists in
    your Libraryâ€¦).

faq01:
    MPD_sima offers an option to tune the percentage of similarity (the one
    retrieve from/computed by last.fm).  The default value is 22%. It means
    that artists less than 22% similar will not get selected looking in MPD
    music library.
    You can modify it to get artists more similar changing option "similarity"
    in your configuration file.
    BE AWARE that high level of similarity might end up with no artist found!
    The default value was chosen because of the good compromise it offers,
    compromise between pretty similar artists queued and continuous playing.

faq02:
    I did not run test to explore MPD_sima's behaviour in proxy environment.
    Some users have reported it to works well regarding last.fm request
    provided that HTTP_PROXY env. var. is set. MPD server connection should not
    be affected. Any feed back would be more than welcome.

faq03:
    I know a particular case where MPD_sima may add twice the same title.
    Lets say "Stairway to Heaven" is queued and played but somehow it is queued
    5 tracks later.
    A possible explanation is that you have twice the same "title" in your
    library, meaning you have two files tagged with the same artist and title.
    MPD_sima is only checking if the *file* has already been played, not the
    couple "artist/title".
    In case of "Stairway to Heaven" it probably means you have the title from
    the album and may be another one from a best-of or a movie OST, etc.
