Description: # Mezzanine File Collections
        
        Mezzanine File Collection is a simple file container page type for the
        Django / Mezzanine CMS.
        
        The Mezzanine's core gallery module only deals with images. I got frustrated
        with it, I quickly developed an alternative to handle any filetype.
        
        Most of this app's code is directly inspired from the Mezzanine's core.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Installation is quite simple.
        
            $ pip install mezzanine-file-collections
        
        Add "mezzanine_file_collections" to your list of installed apps. Then migrate
        your database. That's it.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once installed, just create a new "File collection", and upload your files
        the usual way.
        
        The default templates uses Bootstrap's media objects for a basic rendering,
        but it's very easy to overwrite it. Just look into the template.
