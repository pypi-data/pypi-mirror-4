delete-vpn-gateway
******************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Deletes a VPN gateway. Use this when you want to delete a VPC and all
its associated components because you no longer need them. We
recommend that before you delete a VPN gateway, you detach it from the
VPC and delete the VPN connection. Note that you don't need to delete
the VPN gateway if you just want to delete and re-create the VPN
connection between your VPC and data center.
