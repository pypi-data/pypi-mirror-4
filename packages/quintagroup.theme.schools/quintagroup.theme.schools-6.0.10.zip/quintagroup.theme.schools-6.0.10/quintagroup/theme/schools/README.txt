Features
--------

**Responsive Web Design**

 Among the most interesting features integrated into Schools Theme you can find responsive web design that allows for easy viewing on mobile devices and tablets. If the device screen size is smaller than 5 inches the website will start to automatically resize and reposition the content to accommodate for the changes. 

**Customizable logo**

 Schools diazo theme comes with default Plone logo.  You can replace it with your own as you would do it in default Plone: in ZMI customize  portal_skins -> sunburst_images -> logo.png.

**Configurable left/right column width** 

 Site Setup -> Diazo Theme -> Advanced Settings. In 'Parameter expressions' textarea change the 'columnonewidth' or/and 'columntwowidth' parameters values respectively.

**Improved thumbnail display view**

 To see the changes go to Display dropdown menu and click on Thumbnail view. 

**Top image**

 The theme allows you to replace header image for the whole site or site sections. To have new top image, add image with ``topimage`` shortname into desirable location on site. Default image size is 993*107px. 

 In case you upload higher image, it will not be completely displayed. To change it go to 'Site Setup' -> 'Diazo theme' panel -> and in 'Parameter expressions' textarea set the ``logo_min_height`` parameter value from 107  with a new header height.

**Top portlet**

 Right top area is reserved for a portlet. The first portlet from right column is displayed there.

**Theme Colors**

 You can change links colors: ``links_color``, ``hover_links_color``, and ``visited_links_color``. For this, go to Site Setup -> Diazo Theme -> Advanced Settings. In 'Parameter expressions' textarea change the 'links_color' or/and 'hover_links_color' or/and 'visited_links_color' parameters values respectively.

**Carousel Banner**

 Rotating banners can be added in case you install ``Products.Carousel`` add-on. Custom Carousel display style applies automatically to carousel banner.
 
 To create a banner on the front page, go to the 'Carousel' tab in the task bar. Set carousel options and select 'Carousel Banner' from 'Add new...' dropdown menu. Upload image that will be used as one rotating banner, type its title and text (will be displayed under the image), and provide web address, image title will be linked to. Add as many carousel banners as you need.

 If you need your slogan to be displayed in non-ASCII characters, go to 'Site Setup' -> 'Diazo theme' settings, open 'Advanced settings' tab.  In 'Parameter expressions' change the following field  
 
 ``slogan = string:Free Theme for Plone``
