This package tries to do the best to support the development of sample
data generators. A sample data generator is a pluggable tool to create data
needed for tests. It's an improved version of z3.sampledata and offers an
additional sample data cleanup method next to other improvements. Also see
p01.sampledata for basic samepl data generators.
