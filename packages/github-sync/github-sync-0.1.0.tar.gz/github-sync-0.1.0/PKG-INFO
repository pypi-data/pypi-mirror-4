Description: github-sync: GitHub Repo Syncer
        ================================
        
        This script uses the GitHub API to get a list of all your repos in your GitHub account. If the repo already exists locally, it will update it via git-pull.
        
        Unlike https://github.com/kennethreitz/ghsync this package does not require a directory structure, just point the way to the place where you have to find your repos. The default is "." (current directory), set the correct path::
        
            export GITHUB_SYNC_DIR='/path/to/repos'
        
        
        Install
        -------
        
        To install github-sync, simply run::
        
            $ pip install github-sync
        
        The command ``github-sync`` will then be available to you from the command line.
        
        
        History
        --------
        
        This fork has roots from https://github.com/kennethreitz/ghsync/
        
        I wanted to get my fork is simpler, without the directory structure, etc.
        And just to recursively searched github-repository at the specified path and performed git-pull
