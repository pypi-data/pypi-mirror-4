DVIpy 0.1
=========

DVIpy is a library for reading TeX's DeVice Independent (DVI) files. It is also
a library for running TeX as a "daemon" process, whereby it is given input and
responds with a list of glyphs and their positions. Virtual fonts are treated
transparently: that is, DVIpy just responds with the glyphs from the font
files.

This module should currently be useful for anyone wishing to do some form of
semi-interactive TeX work. It was written as part of a currently unreleased and
unnamed graphics package, the backend to a publication-oriented plotting
package.

Installation should be as usual:

$ python setup.py install

Python 3 is not currently supported, due to changes in file locking which I
have as yet been unable to fix.

TeX 'styles' can be placed in ~/.local/share/dvipy/templates/${name}.tex

A style is a tex file -- see the example in the src/dvipy/templates directory

See examples/ for the singular example. Due to the 'backend' nature of DVIpy,
there is quite a lot of wrangling with cairo to actually make it use freetype.

DVIpy is released under the GPLv2, and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. You
should have received a copy of the license (usually in the file LICENSE) with
this software.
