report-task-progress
********************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Updates the AWS Data Pipeline service on the progress of the calling
task runner. When the task runner is assigned a task, it should call
report-task-progress to acknowledge that it has the task within 2
minutes. If the web service does not recieve this acknowledgement
within the 2 minute window, it will assign the task in a subsequent
poll-for-task call. After this initial acknowledgement, the task
runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its
ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15
minutes by specifying a "reportProgressTimeout" field in your
pipeline. If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes,
AWS Data Pipeline will assume that the task runner is unable to
process the task and will reassign the task in a subsequent response
to  poll-for-task . task runners should call report-task-progress
every 60 seconds.
