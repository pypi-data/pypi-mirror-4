***  WHAT

"paramiko" is a combination of the esperanto words for "paranoid" and "friend".
it's a module for python 2.3 that implements the SSH2 protocol for secure
(encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. unlike SSL (aka
TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical certificates signed by a
powerful central authority. you may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced
telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the protocol also
includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across the
encrypted tunnel (this is how sftp works, for example).

it is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and is
released under the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL). 

the package and its API is fairly well documented in the "doc/" folder that
should have come with this archive.


***  REQUIREMENTS

python 2.3	<http://www.python.org/>
pyCrypt		<http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html>

PyCrypt compiled for Win32 can be downloaded from the HashTar homepage:

***  PORTABILITY

i code and test this library on Linux and MacOS X.  for that reason, i'm
pretty sure that it works for all posix platforms, including MacOS.  i also
think it will work on Windows, though i've never tested it there.  if you
run into Windows problems, send me a patch: portability is important to me.

the Channel object supports a "fileno()" call so that it can be passed into
select or poll, for polling on posix.  once you call "fileno()" on a Channel,
it changes behavior in some fundamental ways, and these ways require posix.
so don't call "fileno()" on a Channel on Windows.  this is detailed in the
documentation for the "fileno" method.


***  DEMO

the demo client (demo.py) is a raw implementation of the normal 'ssh' CLI tool.
while the paramiko library should work on all platforms, the demo app will only
run on posix, because it uses select.

you can run demo.py with no arguments, or you can give a hostname (or
username@hostname) on the command line.  if you don't, it'll prompt you for
a hostname and username.  if you have an ".ssh/" folder, it will try to read
the host keys from there, though it's easily confused.  you can choose to
authenticate with a password, or with an RSA or DSS key.

the demo app leaves a logfile called "demo.log" so you can see what paramiko
logs as it works.  but the most interesting part is probably the code itself,
which hopefully demonstrates how you can use the paramiko library.

a simpler example is in demo_simple.py, which is a copy of the demo client
that uses the simpler "connect" method call (new with 0.9-doduo).

there's also now a demo server (demo_server.py) which listens on port 2200
and accepts a login (robey/foo) and pretends to be a BBS, just to demonstrate
how to perform the server side of things.


***  USE

the demo clients (demo.py & demo_simple.py) and the demo server
(demo_server.py) are probably the best example of how to use this package.
there is also a lot of documentation, generated with epydoc, in the doc/
folder.  point your browser there.  seriously, do it.  mad props to epydoc,
which actually motivated me to write more documentation than i ever would
have before.

there are also unit tests here:
    $ python2 ./test.py
which will verify that some of the core components are working correctly.
not much is tested yet, but it's a start.  the tests for SFTP are probably
the best and easiest examples of how to use the SFTP class.


***  MISSING LINKS

* ctr forms of ciphers are missing (blowfish-ctr, aes128-ctr, aes256-ctr)
* multi-part auth not supported (ie, need username AND pk)
* server mode needs better documentation
* sftp server mode
