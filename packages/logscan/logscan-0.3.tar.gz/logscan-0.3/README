usage:

  logscan [OPTIONS] [LOGFILE]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
description:
  logscan is a command-line-tool to get time-specific access to logfiles.

  It can handle rotated and gzipped logfiles or reads from stdin. The log
  is automatically checked for different timecodes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

positional arguments:
  LOGFILE               If LOGFILE is missing or '-' stdin is read instead.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --info            print the number of logfiles, the start- and the end-
                        time
  -c TIMECODE, --timecode TIMECODE
                        use TIMECODE to parse the date ("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
  -g PATTERN, --grep PATTERN
                        Only lines where PATTERN was found will be printed.
  -d VALUE, --date VALUE
                        Print the log of a specified day.
  -t VALUE [VALUE ...], --time VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        The first VALUE as date, second as daytime. The Date
                        could be omitted. In that case logscan takes the date
                        of the last log-entry. The generic format for the
                        daytime is HHMMSS. You could also use an arbitrary
                        seperator: HH:MM:SS (doing so you don't need two-
                        digit-values). Seconds or seconds and minutes are not
                        obliging. 0322 will be 03:22:00h or just 3 will be
                        03:00:00h. The generic format for the date is
                        DDMM[YY]YY. As well you can use a seperator and one-
                        digit-values. Also the year or the year and the month
                        could be missing. In that case the date will be
                        completed by the actual year and month. Use this
                        option twice to specify two points of time.
  -W VALUE [VALUE ...], --weeks VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        Specifies a duration of weeks, days, hours, minutes
                        and seconds for the given VALUEs in this order.
                        Starting with weeks. Following VALUEs are optional. To
                        specify a 'negative' duration put a '-' in front of
                        all VALUEs. Durations can be speciefied with all
                        upper-case-options. All given durations are taken
                        together, so that '-D 3 0 25' is the same as '-D 3 -M
                        25'.
  -D VALUE [VALUE ...], --days VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        duration with first VALUE as days.
  -H VALUE [VALUE ...], --hours VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        duration with first VALUE as hours.
  -M VALUE [VALUE ...], --minutes VALUE [VALUE ...]
                        duration with first VALUE as minutes.
  -S VALUE, --seconds VALUE
                        duration with first VALUE as seconds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
The calculation of a period works on basis of times and durations:
  no times; no duration:        from start to eof
  one time; no duration:        from time to eof
  two times; no duration:       from time-one to time-two
  no times; positive duration:  form start to end of duration
  no times; negative duration:  from begin of duration to eof
  one time; positive duration:  from time to end of duration
  one time; negative duration:  from begin of duration to time
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To specify different time-formats logscan should automatically check the
logfiles for use the file logscan.conf (probably installed under
/usr/local/etc/).
