    API changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    - The API has been majorly overhauled. Methods that have been
      deprecated will give instructions on the new methods to use.

    Bug fixes
    ~~~~~~~~~

    - Fixed a bug with filled contours
    
    - Fixed bug with remove_layer
    
    - Fixed bug with montage commands

Version 0.9.4

    Important changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Matplotlib 0.99 is now required for APLpy

    New Features
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - methods such as show_contour, show_markers, etc. now return the
      contour, marker, etc. object

    - added a method to retrieve the object in a specific layer:
        -> get_layer()

    - ability to show the beam for the observations:
        -> show_beam()
        -> hide_beam()
        -> set_beam_properties()
      
    - added the ability to show/hide only the x or y axis/tick labels:
        -> show_xtick_labels()
        -> hide_xtick_labels()
        -> show_ytick_labels()
        -> hide_ytick_labels()
        -> show_xaxis_labels()
        -> hide_xaxis_labels()
        -> show_yaxis_labels()
        -> hide_yaxis_labels()
        
    - convenience functions for world to pixel and pixel to world
      conversion:
        -> world2pixel()
        -> pixel2world()
      
    - added a convention= argument to FITSFigure() and show_contour(). This is
      to be used in cases where the WCS interpretation is ambiguous. For
      example, a -CAR projection with CRVAL2<>0 can be interpreted in two
      different ways. If an ambiguous case pops up, APLpy will raise an
      exception and ask for the convention to be specified.

    API changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    - set_labels_latex() is now set_system_latex()
  
    Bug fixes
    ~~~~~~~~~

    - the current position of the cursor in world coordinates is now correctly
      shown in interactive mode
      
    - fixed an issue which caused RGB FITS cubes to be 64-bit
    
    - fixed a bug which meant that the coordinate grid was not updated
      immediately during pan and zoom

Version 0.9.3

    New Features
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - added aplpy.make_rgb_cube() that allows users to make a FITS RGB cube
      from three FITS files with different projections
      
    - added aplpy.make_rgb_image() that allows users to make an RGB file in
      standard image formats from a FITS RGB cube

    - added width= and height= arguments to aplpy.FITSFigure.recenter()
      method.

    - added show_circles(), show_ellipses(), and show_rectangles() to
      aplpy.FITSFigure

    - new hide_grayscale() and hide_colorscale() methods

    API changes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    - changes to the API for set_tick_labels_* and set_axis_labels_* methods

    - percentiles values are now specified between 0 and 100
  
    Bug fixes
    ~~~~~~~~~

    - fixed an issue which ocurred when reading in FITS cubes

    - fixed an issue which led to the last tick along an axis being missing
      for coarse images

    - fixed a bug that occured if set_theme was called before showing the
      image

    - fixed a bug that occured when show_contour was called after removing a
      layer

    Acknowledgments
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Thanks to Paul Ray, Adam Ginsburg, Gus Muench, and forum user hatchell for
    bug reports and feature suggestions.
    
    
Version 0.9.2

    Improvements
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Improved compatibility issues with matplotlib 0.98.6svn

    - Improved speed of initialization of FITSFigure
    
    
Version 0.9.1.2

    Bug fixes
    ~~~~~~~~~
    
    - fixed a major bug that occured when reading in Galactic -CAR images
    
    
Version 0.9.1

    SciPy Dependency Dropped
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    While SciPy is a great python package, it can be troublesome to build and
    install from scratch. Thanks to Tom Aldcroft's suggestion and highlighting
    some of his own code we were able to easily drop the SciPy dependency.

    New Features
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Users can now pass a pyfits HDU instance instead of filenames for both
      FITSFigure() and show_contour() if desired.

    - Users can now specify an existing figure with the figure= argument.

    - Users with a recent enough version of matplotlib (0.98.6svn) can now use
      the subplot= argument to place multiple plots in a single figure.

    - New hide/show_tick_labels() and hide/show_axis_labels() methods.

    - Show_grayscale and show_colorscale() now accept percentile_lower= and
      percentile_higher= as arguments.

    - Show_grayscale and show_colorscale() now print out vmin and vmax if
      chosen automatically.

    - New recenter() method to pan and zoom non-interactively.

    General Fixes and Optimization
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    - Added HDU keyword for the show_contour() method.
    
    - More robust reading in FITS file for the show_contour() method.
    
    - Warning if FITS files do not exist for FITSFigure() or show_contour().
