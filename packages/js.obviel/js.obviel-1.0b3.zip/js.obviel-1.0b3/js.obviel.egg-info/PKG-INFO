        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Obviel`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Obviel`: http://www.obviel.org
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.obviel``) are published to some URL.
        
        Libraries
        =========
        
        You can the following resources from ``js.obviel``:

        CHANGES
        *******
        
        1.0b3 (2012-12-17)
        ==================
        
        - Packaged Obviel 1.0b3
        
        0.11.1 (2012-01-14)
        ===================
        
        - Fix translation domain.
        
        - My mistake, 0.11-1 did work. Ignore any previous evidence you ever saw of 0.11.1
          before now.
        
        0.11-1 (2012-01-13)
        ===================
        
        - Something in distutils/setuptools/distribute doesn't like the
          'resources' directory being symlinked, it just doesn't see it. As a
          result this never was in the 0.11 release. Try again hacking a real
          resources directory into existence temporarily for this release.
        
        0.11 (2012-01-13)
        =================
        
        - Initial release.
