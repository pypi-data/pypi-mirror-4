test-role
*********


DESCRIPTION
===========

To test the IAM role that's used by Elastic Transcoder to create the
pipeline, send a POST request to the "/2012-09-25/roleTests" resource.

The "test-role" action lets you determine whether the IAM role you are
using has sufficient permissions to let Elastic Transcoder perform
tasks associated with the transcoding process. The action attempts to
assume the specified IAM role, checks read access to the input and
output buckets, and tries to send a test notification to Amazon SNS
topics that you specify.
