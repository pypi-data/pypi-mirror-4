        django-heap
        ===========
        
        Heap is a unique new service that automatically captures all user actions on
        your site including UI interaction.
        
        This library helps developers integrate `Heap analytics`_ into their Django
        projects.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install using pip::
        
            pip install django-heap
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        Add ``heap`` to installed apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                ...
                'heap',
            )
        
        There is no need to run ``manage.py syncdb`` since django-heap has no database
        tables. Add the ``heap`` context processor::
        
            TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
                ...
                'heap.context_processors.heap',
            )
        
        Finally, configure the app ID in ``settings.py``::
        
            HEAP_APP_ID = '12345...'
        
        To enable Heap tracking, you must include the script tag snippet in your
        template like so::
        
            <head>
                ....
                {% include 'heap/script.html' %}
            </head>
        
        Now you are ready to start tracking.
        
        Tracking superusers
        ===================
        
        By default, django-heap tracks your site's superusers as well. You can disable
        this by setting the ``HEAP_TRACK_SUPERUSER`` flag to ``False``. This prevents
        the script tag template from rendering when user has ``is_superuser`` property
        set to ``True``.
        
        Customizing django-heap
        =======================
        
        You can customize django-heap by simply overriding the default template. There
        is currently no direct support for custom tracking calls, but it is planned for
        the next release.
