    A pool of threads that can grow and shrink between limits set by the
    THREADPOOL_MINTHREADS and THREADPOOL_MAXTHREADS config items.
    Make sure to set the ``workerFactory`` attribute after creation,
    to a callable that returns a worker thread object.

    ....this class didn't turn out to be as nice as I wanted; you still need to do
    quite a lot of work yourself in the worker threads or the controlling code.
    Worker threads need to call updateWorking with +1 or -1 when they start or finish work,
    and controlling code needs to call growIfNeeded when processing tasks. Also, when a worker
    thread exits, it needs to call remove by itself to actually remove it from the pool.
    Maybe I'll refactor this thing in the future.
