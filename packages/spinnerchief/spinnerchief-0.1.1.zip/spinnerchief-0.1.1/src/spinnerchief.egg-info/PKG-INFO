Description: =====================================
        Python bindings for SpinnerChief API.
        =====================================
        
        `Spinner Chief <http://www.spinnerchief.com/>`_ is an online
        service for spinning text (synonym substitution) that creates unique version(s)
        of existing text. This package provides a way to easily interact with
        `SpinnerChief API <http://developer.spinnerchief.com/API_Document.aspx>`_.
        Usage requires an account, `get one here <http://account.spinnerchief.com/>`_
        and an api key which you get by registering
        a `developer account <http://developer.spinnerchief.com/>`_.
