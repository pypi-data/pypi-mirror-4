Description: An experimental nose plugin to block access to external services that you
        really should not be accessing in your unit tests.
        
        To use::
        
          pip install nose-blockage
        
        Then add the following to your tests::
        
          --with-blockage
        
        Blocking HTTP
        -------------
        
        By default it whitelists `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. To change the whitelist::
        
          --http-whitelist=some.site,some.other.site
        
        If the code hits a http connection then instead of completing it will raise a
        MockHTTPCall exception. Please go and mock your tests appropriately.
        
        Blocking SMTP
        -------------
        
        By default it whitelists no domains. To change the whitelist::
        
          --smtp-whitelist=some.site
        
        It will raise a MockSMTPCall exception.
