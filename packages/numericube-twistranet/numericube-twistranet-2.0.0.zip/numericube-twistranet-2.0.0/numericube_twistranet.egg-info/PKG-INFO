        Requirements
        ============
        
        TwistraNet is written in PYTHON (>= 2.6)
        Twistranet is based on Django Framework (as of writing, for v2.0.0 Django >= 1.4 is mandatory,)
        
        If Django is always installed you can install twistranet over your Django platform.
        Otherwise The last Django version will be downloaded and installed at setup.
        
        Other requirements:
        
        - pip http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/1.2.1
        
        - python-imaging (aka PIL) http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
        
        - python-ldap, only if you want to authenticated against LDAP/Active Directory.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation - short version
        -----------------------------
        
        - Install requirements (Python 2.6, pip and PIL)
        
        - In any directory, just execute:
        
          - (sudo) pip install numericube-twistranet
        
        twistranet is now installed.
        You can have many sites with just one twistranet installation, so you need to explicitly deploy and bootstrap your new site.
        
          - (sudo) twistranet_project <path_to_my_new_site>
        
        Don't forget to write down your generated admin password (just look at first server start LOG)!!
        
        Your server should now be fully working and running on http://localhost:8000 !
        
        If you want to start it again:
        
        - cd <path_to_my_new_site>
        
        - python ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
        
        Installation - the Big Picture
        ------------------------------
        
        Installation is in fact a 2 steps process. You must install twistranet's core features as a python library,
        then you have to create a project (which is an instance of a twistranet site).
        
        To install twistranet's core features:
        
        - Download and install Python >= 2.6 (with pip and PIL)
        
        - Execute (as a superuser) "pip install numericube-twistranet" ; this will normally download and install twistranet and all dependencies.
        
        To create a new project:
        
        - In the directory you want your website files created, type "python twistranet_project -n [<template>] <project_path>",
            where <project_path> is the name of your site (it will be created by the process) ;
            <template> is the name of the project template to deploy. Currently admitted values are:
                
            - 'default' (which is... the default value), an empty project based on sqlite;
            
            - 'cogip', a sample french-language project of a fictious company called COGIP.
            
        The '-n' (or '--no-bootstrap') is an option to tell the twistranet_project script not to bootstrap it
        immediately (the bootstraping process is the initial database feed).
        
        You can do it by hand once (and only once!) with the following commands:
        
        - Go to your <project_path>
        
        - Review the settings.py file and local_settings.py, change to whatever suits your needs.
        
          Among other things, carefully choose your DATABASE scheme, your LDAP/AD settings and the 'admin' password
          that has been generated for you.
        
        - Execute "./manage.py bootstrap" to build the database
        
        Running Twistranet :
        
        - Execute ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0 to start playing with twistranet.
        
        - Point your browser at http://localhost:8000
        
        
        More informations
        =================
        
        You can get more informations in the "docs" folder inside the package about:
        
        - installing pip
        
        - installing/upgrading/uninstalling twistranet with pip
        
        - installing twistranet with pip behind a proxy
        
        - installing Twistranet for testing and development
          (using virtualenv / installing in place the devel package from github.com / localization / running tests ...)
        
        - Running Twistranet in debug mode
        
        
        Troubleshooting
        ================
        
        No image / thumbnail on my fresh twistranet instance!
        ------------------------------------------------------
        
        This is probably a problem with python-imaging installation. Just install PIL for your OS.
        
        Under debian, the easiest is to do "apt-get install python-imaging".
        
        error: Could not find required distribution Django
        ---------------------------------------------------
        
        If you've got this message, that means the autoinstall procedure of twistranet can't install django automatically.
        Just install django (see www.django-project.org) either from sources or from a package from your OS,
        and run "python setup.py install" again.
        
        
        I've lost my admin password!
        ----------------------------
        
        It's easy to set a new one.
        
        - Stop your server
        
        - Run ./manage.py changepassword admin (and change your password)
        
        - Start your server again
        
        error when using mod_python
        ---------------------------
        mod_wsgi is recommended, but if you need mod_python
        this little django1.2.5 hack is needed :
        
        - in django.http.init: do not use "from mod_python.util import parse_qsl"
        
        replace the lines 7 to 11 with::
        
          from cgi import parse_qsl
