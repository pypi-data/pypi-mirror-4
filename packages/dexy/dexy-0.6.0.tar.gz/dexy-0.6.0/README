Dexy should work on Python 2.6-Python 2.7.

Dexy runs on Windows (though it's not comprehensively tested so you may run
into issues). Not all of the Dexy filters are windows-compatible, however.

Dexy's tests can be run with the command `nosetests`.

The tests located in dexy/tests/filters may require extra software to be
installed, so that the filters being tested can run. To skip those tests and
just run basic tests that don't require extra software, run
`nosetests dexy/tests/*.py`
