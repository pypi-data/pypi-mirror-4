**********


DESCRIPTION
===========

To create a job, send a POST request to the "/2012-09-25/jobs"
resource.

When you create a job, Elastic Transcoder returns JSON data that
includes the values that you specified plus information about the job
that is created.


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws elastictranscoder create-job
     --input <value>
     --pipeline-id <value>
     --output <value>


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--input"  (structure)
   A section of the request body that provides information about the
   file that is being transcoded.

   "container"  (string)
      The container type for the input file. If you want Elastic
      Transcoder to automatically detect the container type of the
      input file, specify "auto" . If you want to specify the
      container type for the input file, enter one of the following
      values:

      "3gp" , "asf" , "avi" , "divx" , "flv" , "mkv" , "mov" , "mp4" ,
      "mpeg" , "mpeg-ps" , "mpeg-ts" , "mxf" , "ogg" , "vob" , "wav" ,
      "webm"

   "frame_rate"  (string)
      The frame rate of the input file. If you want Elastic Transcoder
      to automatically detect the frame rate of the input file,
      specify "auto" . If you want to specify the frame rate for the
      input file, enter one of the following values:

      "10" , "15" , "23.97" , "24" , "25" , "29.97" , "30" , "60"

      If you specify a value other than "auto" , Elastic Transcoder
      disables automatic detection of the frame rate.

   "key"  (string)
      The name of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the body of the
      JSON block is the the ID of the pipeline to use for processing
      the job. The "InputBucket" object in that pipeline tells Elastic
      Transcoder which Amazon S3 bucket to get the file from.

      If the file name includes a prefix, such as
      "cooking/lasagna.mpg" , include the prefix in the key. If the
      file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns
      an error.

   "aspect_ratio"  (string)
      The aspect ratio of the input file. If you want Elastic
      Transcoder to automatically detect the aspect ratio of the input
      file, specify "auto" . If you want to specify the aspect ratio
      for the output file, enter one of the following values:

      "1:1" , "4:3" , "3:2" , "16:9"

      If you specify a value other than "auto" , Elastic Transcoder
      disables automatic detection of the aspect ratio.

   "resolution"  (string)
      The resolution, in pixels, of the input file. If you want
      Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the resolution of the
      input file, specify "auto" . If you want to specify the
      resolution for the input file, enter values in the format *width
      in pixels* by *height in pixels* .

      If you specify a value other than "auto" , Elastic Transcoder
      disables automatic detection of the resolution.

   "interlaced"  (string)
      Whether the input file is interlaced. If you want Elastic
      Transcoder to automatically detect whether the input file is
      interlaced, specify "auto" . If you want to specify whether the
      input file is interlaced, enter one of the following values:

      "true" , "false"

      If you specify a value other than "auto" , Elastic Transcoder
      disables automatic detection of interlacing.

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "container": "string",
        "frame_rate": "string",
        "key": "string",
        "aspect_ratio": "string",
        "resolution": "string",
        "interlaced": "string"
      }

"--pipeline-id"  (string)
   The "Id" of the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder to use
   for transcoding. The pipeline determines several settings,
   including the Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets
   the files to transcode and the bucket into which Elastic Transcoder
   puts the transcoded files.

"--output"  (structure)
   A section of the request body that provides information about the
   transcoded (target) file.

   "thumbnail_pattern"  (string)
      Whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails for
      your videos and, if so, how you want Elastic Transcoder to name
      the files.

      If you don't want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails,
      specify "".

      If you do want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, specify
      the information that you want to include in the file name for
      each thumbnail. You can specify the following values in any
      sequence:

      * ** "{count}" (Required)** : If you want to create thumbnails,
        you must include "{count}" in the "ThumbnailPattern" object.
        Wherever you specify "{count}" , Elastic Transcoder adds a
        five-digit sequence number (beginning with **00001** ) to
        thumbnail file names. The number indicates where a given
        thumbnail appears in the sequence of thumbnails for a
        transcoded file.

      Warning: If you specify a literal value and/or "{resolution}" but you
        omit "{count}" , Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error
        and does not create the job.

      * **Literal values (Optional)** : You can specify literal values
        anywhere in the "ThumbnailPattern" object. For example, you
        can include them as a file name prefix or as a delimiter
        between "{resolution}" and "{count}" .

      * ** "{resolution}" (Optional)** : If you want Elastic
        Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name, include
        "{resolution}" in the "ThumbnailPattern" object.

      When creating thumbnails, Elastic Transcoder automatically saves
      the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears in the
      preset that you specified in the "PresetID" value of
      "CreateJobOutput" . Elastic Transcoder also appends the
      applicable file name extension.

   "rotate"  (string)
      The number of degrees clockwise by which you want Elastic
      Transcoder to rotate the output relative to the input. Enter one
      of the following values:

      "auto" , "0" , "90" , "180" , "270"

      The value "auto" generally works only if the file that you're
      transcoding contains rotation metadata.

   "preset_id"  (string)
      The "Id" of the preset to use for this job. The preset
      determines the audio, video, and thumbnail settings that Elastic
      Transcoder uses for transcoding.

   "key"  (string)
      The name to assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder
      saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the
      "OutputBucket" object in the pipeline that is specified by the
      pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name already exists in
      the output bucket, the job fails.

   *Parameter Syntax*

        "thumbnail_pattern": "string",
        "rotate": "string",

      }
