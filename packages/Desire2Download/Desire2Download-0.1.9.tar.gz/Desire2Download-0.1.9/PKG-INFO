Description: 
        
           Download all of the content from the University of Waterloo's
           new learning management system which uses Desire2Learn instead of the old Angel
           based UWACE.
        
           d2d was inspired by Jamie Wong's fabulous [UWAngel-CLI](https://github.com/phleet/UWAngel-CLI)
           written in Ruby.
        
           d2d is somewhat hacky and has not been tested extensively. If you do find a bug,
           please [let us know](https://github.com/sholiday/desire2download/issues)
        
           To install, just do either:
        
               - python setup.py install
               - pip install desire2download
        
           To use d2d, just browse to the folder you want to download the files in, type
           d2d and hit enter! d2d will not download a file if it has been already saved.
        
           Examples:
               - d2d
               - d2d --username ktalwar
               - d2d -u ktalwar -p icanhazcatz
               - d2d -i ".*.ppt"
               - d2d -u scholida -p hecanhazcatz -i ".*.ppt" -c "CS+"
        
           Result:
               Username: scholida
