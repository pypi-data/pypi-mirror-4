Description: Bitcoins: Cryptocurrency for Humans
        ===================================
        
        Bitcoins is an MIT licensed cryptocurrency library, written in Python, for human
        beings.
        
        Nothing is complicated when it's in Python. Not even cryptocurrencies.
        
        ::
        
            >>> bitcoins.get_difficulty()
            2694047.952955
        
        For now, this library is only a wrapper to BlockExplorer's stats API. This might
        change as the project matures.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Getting the current difficulty as a multiple of the minimum difficulty
          (highest target)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install bitcoins, simply: ::
        
            $ pip install bitcoins
        
        Or, if you have to: ::
        
            $ easy_install bitcoins
        
        But, you probably shouldn't do that.
