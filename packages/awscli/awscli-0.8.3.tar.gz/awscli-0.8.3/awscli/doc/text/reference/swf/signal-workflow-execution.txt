signal-workflow-execution
*************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Records a "WorkflowExecutionSignaled" event in the workflow execution
history and creates a decision task for the workflow execution
identified by the given domain, --workflow-id and runId. The event is
recorded with the specified user defined --signal-name and --input (if
provided).

Note: If a --run-id is not specified, then the "WorkflowExecutionSignaled"
  event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow with
  the matching --workflow-id in the domain.

Note: If the specified workflow execution is not open, this method fails
  with "UnknownResource" .

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .
