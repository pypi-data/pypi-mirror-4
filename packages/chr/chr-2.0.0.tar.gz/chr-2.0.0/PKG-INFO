        **chr** (coded under the name ``chru``) is a Python based URL shortening service which uses Flask as a front end, and pysqlw as the SQL backend, to interface with sqlite3.
        
        It can shrink billions of unique URLs with less than 6 characters, run in the background with no human interaction, and it can fly like a bird -- or is that Super Man?
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Can shorten several billion (yes!) unique urls to a less than 6 character slug.
        - Verifies the shrunk URLs are legitimate, to stop abuse.
        - Uses reCAPTCHA to stop spammers from using the service for evil, not good.
        - Slugs are the base62 representation of their ID, so they'll work in all browsers.
        - A live chr instance is located at `chr.so <http://chr.so>`_.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        - `Python 27 <http://python.org>`_ (``>=2.7`` required because of use of ``argparse`` module)
        - `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org>`_ (``python-requests``)
        - `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ (``flask``)
        - `Flask KVSession <https://github.com/mbr/flask-kvsession>`_ (``flask-kvsession``)
        - `recaptcha client <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/recaptcha-client>`_ (``recaptcha-client``)
        - `mattdaemon <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mattdaemon>`_ (``mattdaemon>=1.1.0``)
        - `pysqlw <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysqlw>`_ (``pysqlw>=1.3.0``)
        
        To install all of these: ``pip -r requirements.txt install`` (if installing from source)
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        - It's **highly** recommended by the chr developers that if you're putting this in a production environment (read: *any computer with a public IP*) that you look at the various `Flask deployment <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying>`_ options, such as putting it behind nginx, lighttpd, or something.
        - It's also recommended that you get your server (nginx, lighttpd, or hell, even Apache) serve out the static folder, rather than letting Flask do it.
        - This will take a while to get fully featured, but we have a lot planned.
        - `jqPlot <http://www.jqplot.com>`_ comes bundled with chr, which is alright as it's MIT licensed.
