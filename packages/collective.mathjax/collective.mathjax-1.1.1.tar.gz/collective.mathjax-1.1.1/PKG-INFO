        Changes
        =======
        
        1.1.1 (2013-02-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Also do not use ResourceRegistry's caching mechanism for the MathJax.

        1.1 (2013-01-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not cook the MathJax Resource, otherwise ResourceRegistry doesn't include
          it, since it thinks it cannot be found. Also, insert it at the end, so that
          other resources can be better merged together.
