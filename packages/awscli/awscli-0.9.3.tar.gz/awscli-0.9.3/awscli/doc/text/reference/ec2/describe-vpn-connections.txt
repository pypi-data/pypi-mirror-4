describe-vpn-connections
************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Gives you information about your VPN connections.

Warning: We strongly recommend you use HTTPS when calling this operation
  because the response contains sensitive cryptographic information
  for configuring your customer gateway.You can filter the results to
  return information only about VPN connections that match criteria
  you specify. For example, you could ask to get information about a
  particular VPN connection (or all) only if the VPN's state is
  pending or available. You can specify multiple filters (e.g., the
  VPN connection is associated with a particular VPN gateway, and the
  gateway's state is pending or available). The result includes
  information for a particular VPN connection only if the VPN
  connection matches all your filters. If there's no match, no special
  message is returned; the response is simply empty. The following
  table shows the available filters.

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--filters"  (list)
   A list of filters used to match properties for VPN Connections. For
   a complete reference to the available filter keys for this
   operation, see the Amazon EC2 API reference .

      (structure)
         A filter used to limit results when describing tags. Multiple
         values can be specified per filter. A tag must match at least
         one of the specified values for it to be returned from an
         operation.

         Wildcards can be included in filter values; "*" specifies
         that zero or more characters must match, and "?" specifies
         that exactly one character must match. Use a backslash to
         escape special characters. For example, a filter value of
         "\*amazon\?\\" specifies the literal string "*amazon?\" .

            Contains one or more values for the filter.
