        Changes
        -------
        
        v1.4.1
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **CHANGE**: Make it possible to pass host, and credentials to the
          ``vertica_migrate`` tool by using an config file (to not expose credentials
          on the command-line).
        
        
        v1.4.0
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **CHANGE**: Make it more easy to pass more arguments to ``get_connection``
          through ``BaseImporter`` and ``VerticaBatch.`` Note that this is a backwards
          incompatible change as the arguments for ``BaseImporter``, ``VerticaBatch``
          and ``get_connection`` have changed.
        
        
        v1.3.0
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **FEATURE**: Add a migration module ``pyvertica.migrate``and script
          ``vertica_migrate``, to move data between clusters.
        * **CHANGE**: Make the reconnect optional in ``VerticaBatch.get_connection``
        
        
        v1.2.4
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **CHANGE**: Make the execution of ``ANALYZE_CONSTRAINTS`` optional (executed
          when getting the errors).
        
        
        v1.2.3
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **FIX**: Handle exceptions raised inside the ``QueryThread`` so that the
          semaphore always gets released.
        
        v1.2.2
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **FIX**: Line-endings in file-object returned by ``get_errors``. All is now
          ``\n``.
        
        
        v1.2.1
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **CHANGE**: The Batch-history table is now configurable in ``BaseImporter``.
        * **CHANGE**: ``get_connection`` selects a random node from the cluster
          and returns a connection to that node.
        * **FIX**: Cleanup fifo + temporary directory.
        
        v1.2.0
        ~~~~~~
        
        * **CHANGE**: Change the way in how we detect if the FIFO object is consumed
          by the QueryThread. By opening the FIFO object (for writing) in ``'w'`` mode
          after the QueryThread was created, it will block until the COPY SQL statement
          is started.
        
        
        v1.1.2
        ~~~~~~
        
        * Public release!
