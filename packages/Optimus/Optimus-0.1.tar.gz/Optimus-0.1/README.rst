Introduction
============

A simple building environment to produce static HTML from `Jinja2`_ templates and with assets compress managing with `webassets`_.

The environment should bring all needed stuff and a script to build static website with benefit of templating with `Jinja2`_ and compressed assets (for production) with `webassets`_.

It try to cohabit with a Compass or Less environment, but this part is actually not ready.

Better documentation to come when this will be ready. Currently the project is failing to really help to cohabits with Compass in development environment.
