Description: pwt.closure is Python package that provides the tools to compile and manage
        JavaScript files. It is optimized to be used with the Closure Library to find
        your web application JavaScript dependencies. It then uses the Closure
        Compiler to concatenate and compile all your JavaScript to JavaScript that
        is optimized for production.
        
        pwt.closure contains a command line tool, a WSGI application and integration
        with zc.buildout. All are configured through the same .ini file. The WSGI
        application is suited for developing JavaScript heavy applications and is
        used manly for development. Once development is finished you can use the
        command line tool to optimize the application by compiling all your JavaScript
        into one optimized file. Or you can integrate the process with zc.buildout.
