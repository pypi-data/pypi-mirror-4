pyabm
======

pyabm is an agent-based modeling toolkit written to simplify coding and running 
agent-based models in the Python programming language. pyabm includes basic 
classes for creation of agents, has tools to output model results (as text 
files, plots or ESRI shapefiles), has a parameter handling system to ease the 
process of model testing and validation, and has utilities to assist in running 
multiple scenarios with varying model parameters.

Construction of pyabm is supported as part of an ongoing National Science 
Foundation Partnerships for International Research and Education (NSF PIRE) 
project `(grant OISE 0729709) <http://pire.psc.isr.umich.edu>`_
Development of pyabm is ongoing, and the documentation is still a work in 
progress.

See the `pyabm website <http://rohan.sdsu.edu/~zvoleff/research/pyabm>`_ for 
more information, past releases, publications, and recent presentations.
