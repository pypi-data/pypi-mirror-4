  <p>
    Thanks a lot for participating in the user trial of the SKIMMR technology!
    In the following you will find a description of what we are asking you to
    do. Remember, it is SKIMMR that is being evaluated here, not you! So 
    whenever you experience any problems or find something fishy in the 
    results, let us know either using the provided feedback forms, or via 
    <a href="mailto:vit_dot_novacek--at--deri_dot_org">e-mail</a>. Also, please 
    do let us know if you run into any technical difficulties, we will do our 
    best to provide technical support asap. If you need a quick reference
    when working with SKIMMR, you can always visit the 
    <a href="/html/about.tmp">about</a> page.
  </p>
  <br/><br/>

  <h3>1. Before you start:</h3>
  </br>

  <ul>
    <li>watch the <a href="/html/tutorial.m4v">tutorial video</a> - a quick
    but comprehensive explanation of how to use SKIMMR and what 
    is it good for</li>
    <li><a href="/html/register.tmp">register</a> as a new user</li>
    <li>optionally, follow the steps shown in the video yourself to get 
    hands-on experience before starting the actual trial</li>
    <li><a href="/html/login.tmp">login</a> into SKIMMR to continue with the
    trial itself (this can always be done simply by clicking on the logo in 
    the upper part of every SKIMMR page)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Starting off the skimming with SMA:</h3>
  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>once you are logged in, start with the query <i>SMA</i></li>
    <li>skim and read from there as you wish, optionally providing feedback 
    on the particular query results if you feel like telling us something 
    important (if in doubt about how to fill in the feedback forms, 
    check out these <a href="/html/about.tmp#evaluation">guidelines</a>)</li>
    <li>continue until you have found something interesting or until you get 
    bored</li>
    <li>once finished, login again into SKIMMR before continuing (this will 
    help us to discern different user sessions in the logs later on)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Free exploration:</h3>
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
    <li>after logging in again, ask whatever query you like, skim the entity 
    networks and explore the related publications as you wish, optionally 
    providing feedback on the particular results
    <li>if you engage in multiple unrelated skim reading sessions during this 
    task, please login again whenever you start a new session</li>
    <li>note that you can play with SKIMMR at leisure (it will be on-line 
    most of the time except of short periods possibly required for resolving 
    glitches in the prototype system)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Usability survey:</h3>
  <br/>

  <ul>
    <li>after you will have played enough with SKIMMR, please fill in the 
    <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B75T6P6">usability questionnaire</a>
    - it should not take more than 15 minutes even if you decide to be very
    verbous</li>
    <li>you can also contact 
    <a href="mailto:vit_dot_novacek--at--deri_dot_org">us</a> anytime if
    you have any additional feedback, feature requests, suggestions for
    improvement, etc.</li>
  </ul>
