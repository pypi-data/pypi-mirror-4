        *********************
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `CSS3 GitHub Buttons`_ for `fanstatic`_. Check out
        a `demo`_ of this library - it's really nice. This library provides
        the default buttons and various extensions as per the demo.
        
        There's a *lot* of versions of this CSS library floating around,
        so we're currently using the one provided by ``CodeFusion``, a fork
        of the library originally provided by 
        `necolas <https://github.com/necolas/css3-github-buttons>`_, on GitHub.
        
        If development moves elsewhere, we can adjust the library accordingly.
        If you're using this package and notice a change in development at
        https://github.com/CodeFusion/css3-github-buttons/network (such as
        someone has taken over development more than original author or is otherwise
        doing more work) before we do, let us know or send a pull request.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Install using your favourite method (``pip``, ``easy_install``, ``buildout``,
        etc) and then in your code do this::
        
            import css.css3githubbuttons
            css.css3githubbuttons.buttons.need()
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``css.css3githubbuttons``) are published to some URL.
        
        For Pyramid, this can be as simple as installing and utilising 
        `pyramid_fanstatic`_.
        
        Extensions
        ----------
        
        ``CodeFusion`` has provided a number of improvements and extensions to the
        original library.  This Fanstatic package provides access to these extensions
        like so::
        
            from css.css3githubbuttons import buttons_ext_sizes, buttons_ext_icons, buttons_ext_all
        
        For extra button sizes (see
        http://demo.codefusionlab.com/css3-github-buttons/ext_button_size/index.html)::
        
            buttons_ext_sizes.need()
        
        For extra (larger) icons (see
        http://demo.codefusionlab.com/css3-github-buttons/ext_button_icons/index.html)::
        
            buttons_ext_icons.need()
        
        Or for everything, do this::
        
            buttons_ext_all.need()
        
        Keep in mind that extensions automatically depend on the original CSS so
        you don't need to ``need()`` that again!
        
        Updating this package
        =====================
        
        Given this package uses the latest (at the time of writing) GitHub master
        of the CSS library, it may (will) need updating at some point.  Do this
        at the base of the repository::
        
            pushd css/css3githubbuttons/resources
            wget https://github.com/CodeFusion/css3-github-buttons/archive/master.tar.gz
            rm -rf css3-github-buttons
            tar xf master.tar.gz
            rm master.tar.gz
            git mv css3-github-buttons-master css3-github-buttons
            git add css3-github-buttons
            popd
            git commit -a -m "Updated to latest version"
            git push
        
        Note
        ----
        
        We could use Git submodules but setuptools seems to *hate* them,
        ``setuptools-git`` really doesn't want to agree with them,
        ``zest.releaser`` doesn't support recursive cloning (yet; pull request
        sent), and so forth. Feel free to help improve this situation! Yikes!
        
        So, let's resort to manually taking a copy of the files out of GitHub.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`CSS3 GitHub Buttons`: https://github.com/CodeFusion/css3-github-buttons
        .. _`demo`: http://demo.codefusionlab.com/css3-github-buttons/
        .. _`pyramid_fanstatic`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyramid_fanstatic
        
        
        
        Tests - How to use
        ==================
        
        You can import ``buttons`` from ``css.css3githubbuttons`` and ``need`` it
        where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from css.css3githubbuttons import buttons
          >>> buttons.need()
        
        
        Changelog
        *********
        
        
        2.0 (2012-12-07)
        ================
        
        - Switched to using CodeFusion's fork of necolas' GitHub buttons.
          See demo at http://demo.codefusionlab.com/css3-github-buttons/. As well as
          several fixes, this now provides disabled buttons, no text buttons, colours,
          more icons, and more sizes. Backwards compatibility should be maintained if
          you are not using new features (some extra CSS is introduced in the basic
          file).
