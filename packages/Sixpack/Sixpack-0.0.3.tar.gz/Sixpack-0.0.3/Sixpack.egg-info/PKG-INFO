Description: Sixpack

        Sixpack is a tool to help solve the problem of A/B testing across multiple programming languages. It does this by exposing a very simple API that a client library in virtually any language can make requests against.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        * Redis
        * Python >= 2.7 (3.0 Untested, Pull Requests welcome)
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        To get going create (or don't, but you really should) a new virtualenv for your sixpack installation. Follow that up with a `pip install`
        
        `$ pip install sixpack`
        
        
        
        Deployment
        ==========
        
        Production Notes
        ----------------
        
        To run the sixpack server using gunicorn/gevent - a separate installation - you can run the following::
        
            gunicorn --access-logfile - -w 8 --worker-class=gevent sixpack.server:start
        
        To run the sixpack web dashboard using gunicorn/gevent - a separate installation - you can run the following::
        
            gunicorn --access-logfile - -w 2 --worker-class=gevent sixpack.web:start
        
        Starting Sixpack (Developement)
        -------------------------------
        
        To start the sixpack server in development mode::
        
            cd sixpack
            # virtualenv here, if you want
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            PYTHONPATH=. SIXPACK_CONFIG=config.yml bin/sixpack
        
        The sixpack server will be accessible at ``localhost:5000``
        
        To seed some random data::
        
            cd sixpack
            # create a virtualenv here, if you want
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            bin/sixpack-seed # (with above server running)
        
        Starting Sixpack-Web (Development)
        ----------------------------------
        
        To start the sixpack web dashboard in development mode::
        
            cd sixpack
            # virtualenv here, if you want
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            PYTHONPATH=. SIXPACK_CONFIG=config.yml bin/sixpack-web
        
        
        The sixpack web dashboard will be accessible at ``localhost:5001``
