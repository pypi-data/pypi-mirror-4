Installation
============

The easyiest way to install Checker is::

  easy_install checker

This will give you an executable ``checker`` script in the same
location as your other python global scripts.

Or, if you're using `zc.buildout`, use the `zc.recipe.egg`__ recipe to
get a checker script as follows:

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg

.. topic:: buildout.cfg
 :class: file

 ::

   [buildout]
   parts = checker

   [checker]
   recipe = zc.recipe.egg    
   eggs = checker

 .. -> buildout_cfg

.. check the above actually works:

  >>> write(sample_buildout,'buildout.cfg',buildout_cfg)
  >>> output = system(buildout).split('\n')
  >>> for word in ('Upgraded', 'setuptools', 'restarting',
  ...               "buildout'.", 'Installing'):
  ...     to_check = output[0].strip()
  ...     if (to_check.startswith(word) 
  ...         or to_check.endswith(word)
  ...         or not to_check.strip()):
  ...         output = output[1:]
  >>> print '\n'.join(output)
  Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/checker'.
  <BLANKLINE>

This will give you an executable ``checker`` script in the ``bin``
directory of your buildout.

A recommended way to install Checker is to have the :ref:`configuration
folder <configuration-folder>` be a subversion checkout containing
:file:`buildout.cfg`, :file:`bootstrap.py` and your
:file:`checker.txt`.
