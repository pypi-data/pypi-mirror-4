        HotRunner
        #########
        
        HotRunner is an improved django test runner.
        
        To install HotRunner, ``pip install django-hotrunner``.
        
        To use HotRunner, set ``TEST_RUNNER = 'hotrunner.HotRunner'`` in your django 
        settings file.  This enables three useful features:
        
        * **Test exclusion:** None of the ``django.contrib`` tests will be run when 
          you run your test suite.  Neither will any apps you specify in the
          ``EXCLUDED_TEST_APPS`` setting.  You can override this without deleting
          your ``EXLUDED_TEST_APPS``, by setting ``TEST_ALL_APPS`` to a true value.
          ``django.contrib`` apps will still not be run.  To run them, specify them
          by name on the manage.py command line:
          ``python manage.py test django.contrib.auth``
        * **Test timing:** Find out how long each test is running simply by setting
          your verbosity to 2 or higher.  The time it takes to run each successful 
          test will be reported at microsecond granularity::
         
              $ python manage.py test --verbosity
              test_absolute_url (news.tests.NewsModelAbsoluteURLTestCase) ... (1.103603s) ok
              test_empty_body_returns_empty_html (news.tests.NewsModelMarkdownTestCase) ... (0.000215s) ok
              test_markdown_saved_to_html (news.tests.NewsModelMarkdownTestCase) ... (0.014008s) ok
              test_unicode_markdown_converted_appropriately (news.tests.NewsModelMarkdownTestCase) ... (0.000803s) ok
              test_unicode_strings_must_be_decoded (news.tests.NewsModelMarkdownTestCase) ... (0.000683s) ok
              test_basic_slug_creation (news.tests.NewsModelSlugificationTestCase) ... (0.001656s) ok
              test_existing_slugs_do_not_get_overridden (news.tests.NewsModelSlugificationTestCase) ... (0.000307s) ok
              test_slugifying_disambiguates_slugs (news.tests.NewsModelSlugificationTestCase) ... ERROR
        
          Tests that get skipped will not report time, as the information is not 
          relevant.
          
        * XUnit style XML output.  If you set ``HOTRUNNER_XUNIT_FILENAME`` to the path
          to a writeable file, HotRunner will write an XML document of test results to
          that file.  This makes it easy to integrate your project with, for instance,
          a Jenkins continuous integration job.  This functionality was previously
          available via the ``django-jux`` project.  If you are upgrading from 
          ``django-jux``, you can still use the old setting name of ``JUXD_FILENAME``,
          though this is now deprecated, and may disappear at some point in the
          future.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        HotRunner is built for integration with Django as a replacement for its custom 
        test runner.  It builds on functionality in unittest2, so it only works with
        Django 1.3 or higher.
