Description: Products.ScreenReaderNavigation is a simple product that provides
        assistance for users of special navigation devices such as
        screen readers.
        
        It works by adding a start and end header to the navigation portlet so
        that users can quickly navigate the page based on headers.  There has
        to be a screenReaderHelp CSS class defined that only displays text for
        example for the braille media type for this to work properly.  See
        https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12575 for more information.
