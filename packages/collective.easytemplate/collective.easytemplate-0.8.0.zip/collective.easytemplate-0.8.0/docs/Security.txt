Security
========

By default, template functions are limited to the current user priviledges - 
this means that output may vary depending on which user you have logged in.
The user should not be able to escape Zope sandbox. 

However, some tags are not totally secure (escapes viewing priviledges)
and you might want to disable them on multi-user production site.

Security is not guaranteed for this product. For sites with high security requirements,
please consult the author.

Security unit tests are available `here <https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.easytemplate/trunk/collective/easytemplate/tests/test_jinja_zope_security.py>`_.
