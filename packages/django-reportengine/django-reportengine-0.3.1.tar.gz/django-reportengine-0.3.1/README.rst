ReportEngine (for Django 1.1+)
==============================

*Version: Beta*

Overview
--------

Inspired by vitalik's django-reporting
[http://code.google.com/p/django-reporting], ReportEngine seeks to make
something less tied to the ORM to allow for those many instances where complex
reports require some direct sql, or pure python code.

It allows you to add new reports that either feed directly from a model, do
their own custom SQL or run anything in python. Reports can be outputted into
various formats, and you can specify new formats. Reports can have extensible
filter controls, powered by a form (with premade ones for queryset and model
based reports).

Example
-------

Take a look at the sample project and reports in the example folder. To run it
you need to have Django 1.3 or later and reportengine on your PYTHONPATH.
