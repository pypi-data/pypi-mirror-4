get-workflow-execution-history
******************************


DESCRIPTION
===========

Returns the history of the specified workflow execution. The results
may be split into multiple pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make
the call again using the "--next-page-token" returned by the initial
call.

Note: This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
  and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

**Access Control**

You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
resources as follows:

* Use a "Resource" element with the --domain name to limit the action
  to only specified domains.

* Use an "Action" element to allow or deny permission to call this
  action.

* You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

If the caller does not have sufficient permissions to invoke the
action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified
constraints, the action fails by throwing "OperationNotPermitted" .
For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access
to Amazon SWF Workflows .


SYNOPSIS
========

   aws swf get-workflow-execution-history
     --domain <value>
     --execution <value>
     [--next-page-token <value>]
     [--reverse-order ]
     [--maximum-page-size <value>]


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
===================

"--domain"  (string)
   The name of the --domain containing the workflow execution.

"--execution"  (structure)
   Specifies the workflow --execution for which to return the history.

   "workflow_id"  (string)

   "run_id"  (string)

   *Parameter Syntax*

      {
        "workflow_id": "string",
        "run_id": "string"
      }


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
===================

"--next-page-token"  (string)
   If a "NextPageToken" is returned, the result has more than one
   pages. To get the next page, repeat the call and specify the
   --next-page-token with all other arguments unchanged.

"--reverse-order"  (boolean)
   When set to "true" , returns the events in reverse order. By
   default the results are returned in ascending order of the
   "eventTimeStamp" of the events.

"--maximum-page-size"  (integer)
   Specifies the maximum number of history events returned in one
   page. The next page in the result is identified by the
   "NextPageToken" returned. By default 100 history events are
   returned in a page but the caller can override this value to a page
   size *smaller* than the default. You cannot specify a page size
   larger than 100. Note that the number of events may be less than
   the maxiumum page size, in which case, the returned page will have
   fewer results than the --maximum-page-size specified.
