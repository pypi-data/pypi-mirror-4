js.jquery_timeentry
*******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `jQuery Time Entry`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery Time Entry`: http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_timeentry``) are published to some URL.
