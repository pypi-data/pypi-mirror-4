This is an OpenID challenger for TiddlyWeb that replaces the one that
was originally included in the core TiddlyWeb package. It improves on
that one by using the python-openid package, thus supporting OpenID 2
and improved discovery mechanisms.

To use, add 'tiddlywebplugins.openid2' to auth_systems via 
tiddlywebconfig.py. The following example replaces all existing
auth_systems with just openid.

config = {
    'auth_systems': ['tiddlywebplugins.openid2'],
}
