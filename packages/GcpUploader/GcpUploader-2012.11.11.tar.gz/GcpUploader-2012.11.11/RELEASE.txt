Garmin Connect Python Uploader Release Notes:

Release 2012.11.11:
  Comments:
  There have been no changes to the functionality of GcpUploader. It was
  merely converted to a python package that can be installed using pip
  package manager.  Pip is the replacement for Python easy_install.  The
  new package 'GcpUploader' is hosted at http://pypi.python.org/pypi. See 
  README.txt for installation details.

  Changes:
  1) Converted project to a pip installable project (no functional changes)
  2) Changed versioning schema for compatability with pypi version system.  
     Versioning schema is now year.month.day[.subrelease].

Release 20120516:
  Comments:
  Fixed a problem where binary FIT files did not upload successfully to Garmin 
  Connect in Windows.  

  Changes:
  1)  In UploadGarmin.py when uploading .FIT files, open files in 'rb' (read 
      binary) mode.  In Python under Windows there is an important distinction
      between opening files in binary and txt modes.  

Release 20120129:
  Comments:
  No real change of features.  Mostly code cleanup.  

  Changes:
  1)  Obscure password when printing verbose output. This will reduce the 
      chance of users unintentionally disclosing their password.
  2)  When no credentials are given on the command line and no config file is
      present, print the locations that were searched for the config file.
  3)  Added text to help explaining the meaning of various STATUS outputs.
  4)  Removed redundant os.path.expanduser() statement in line 112.
