Description: Pyphen
        ======
        
        Pyphen is a pure Python module to hyphenate text using existing Hunspell
        hyphenation dictionaries.
        
        https://github.com/Kozea/Pyphen
        
        This module is a fork of python-hyphenator, written by Wilbert Berendsen.
        
        https://code.google.com/p/python-hyphenator/
        
        Many dictionaries are included in pyphen, they come from the LibreOffice git
        repository and are distributed under various licenses, including the LGPL
        version 2.1 also used for pyphen.
        
        See: http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/tree/
        
        Usage:
        
        >>> import pyphen
        >>> 'nl_NL' in pyphen.LANGUAGES
        True
        >>> dic = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='nl_NL')
        >>> dic.inserted('lettergrepen')
        'let-ter-gre-pen'
        >>> dic.wrap('autobandventieldopje', 11)
        ('autoband-', 'ventieldopje')
        >>> for pair in dic.iterate('Amsterdam'):
        ...     print(pair)
        ...
        ('Amster', 'dam')
        ('Am', 'sterdam')
        >>>
