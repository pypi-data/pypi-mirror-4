.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Removes the specified EC2 Availability Zones from the set of configured
Availability Zones for the LoadBalancer.
.sp
There must be at least one Availability Zone registered with a LoadBalancer at
all times. A client cannot remove all the Availability Zones from a
LoadBalancer. Once an Availability Zone is removed, all the instances registered
with the LoadBalancer that are in the removed Availability Zone go into the
OutOfService state. Upon Availability Zone removal, the LoadBalancer attempts to
equally balance the traffic among its remaining usable Availability Zones.
Trying to remove an Availability Zone that was not associated with the
LoadBalancer does nothing.
.IP Note
In order for this call to be successful, the client must have created the
LoadBalancer. The client must provide the same account credentials as those
that were used to create the LoadBalancer.
