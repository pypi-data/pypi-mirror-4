* Tahoe Release Checklist [0/19]
  - [ ] update doc files
    - relnotes.txt
    - CREDITS
    - docs/known_issues.rst
    - NEWS.rst: Add release name and date to top-most item in NEWS.
  - [ ] change docs/quickstart.rst to point to just the current
    allmydata-tahoe-X.Y.Z.zip source code file, or else to point to a
    directory which contains only allmydata-tahoe-X.Y.Z.* source code files
  - [ ] git pull
  - [ ] git tag allmydata-tahoe-X.Y.Z
  - [ ] build locally to make sure the release is reporting itself as the
    intended version
  - [ ] make sure buildbot is green
  - [ ] make sure other people aren't committing at that moment
  - [ ] push tag along with some other documentation-only patch (typically to
    relnotes.txt) to trigger buildslaves
    - git push --tags official; git push official
    - that will build tarballs
  - [ ] make sure buildbot is green
  - [ ] make sure a sumo sdist tarball got built and uploaded properly
  - [ ] download tarballs, sign with "gpg -ba -u 68666a7a TAR", upload *.asc
  - [ ] symlink the release tarball on tahoe-lafs.org:
    /var/www/source/tahoe-lafs/releases/
  - [ ] update Wiki: front page news, news, old news, parade of release notes
  - [ ] send out relnotes.txt to:
    - tahoe-announce@tahoe-lafs.org
    - tahoe-dev@tahoe-lafs.org
  - [ ] update https://tahoe-lafs.org/hacktahoelafs/
  - [ ] make an "announcement of new release" on freshmeat
  - [ ] upload to pypi with "python ./setup.py sdist upload register"
    - currently broken (with git). And we want signed tarballs, and we want
      the tarballs to match the ones on tahoe-lafs.org. So instead do this:
      - [ ] login to pypi
      - [ ] from Edit, add new release
      - [ ] upload .tar.gz, .asc
  - [ ] make an "announcement of new release" on launchpad
  - [ ] close the Milestone on the trac Roadmap
