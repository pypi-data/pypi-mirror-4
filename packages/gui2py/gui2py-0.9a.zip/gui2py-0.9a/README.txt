Readme for gui2py

gui2py is a GUI framework for building cross-platform "visual" desktop applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, using the Python language and the wxPython toolkit.
Initially based on PythonCard, it was enhanced to include a modern component object model and patterns (MVC), intuitive design & inspection tools and a compact overall structure.
It also mimics some HTML & Javascript features to lessen the gap between GUI and Web development, trying to have the best of both worlds.

Quick Start:
Try the sample application in this directory, running: `python sample.pyw`
Also, you can start the visual GUI designer with: `python -m gui.tools.designer`
To install, run `python setup.py install`
