0.5.5
-----

*Release date: 19 March 2013*

* Rewrote, updated, and expanded documentation, including the addition
  of the Getting Started guide.
* Added ``inline-contents`` option to the ``slide`` directive.
* Fixed bug with image path calculation for documents in nested trees.
  This primarily impacted images generated by other extensions, such
  as `blockdiag
  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-blockdiag>`_.
* Added support for marking a section as a slide when autoslides are
  disabled.
* All slide-related nodes are now left intact when pruning the tree.
* Fixed bug related to changing themes between documents that resulted
  in Sphinx reporting Template Not Found.
* Fixed level calculation for slides created with the ``slide``
  directive.
* Simplified processing of ``slideconf`` nodes: previously an attempt
  was made to remove them when not building slides. This was fragile,
  and led to breakage in the latex and texinfo builders. They're now
  skipped properly for all builtin Sphinx builders.
* Updated Javascript for incremental slides to work with recent builds
  of Chrome

* Added ``autoslides`` config parameter to allow disabling automatic
  generation of slides from document text.

  for a while, the rename just makes them more expressive.

* Fixed problems with styling nested lists
* Fixed incompatibility with latex-pdf builder
