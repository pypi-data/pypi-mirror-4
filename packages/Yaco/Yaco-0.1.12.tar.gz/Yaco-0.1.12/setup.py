"""
Yaco provides a configuration object that can be saved to disk as a YAML
file. Yaco can be used to store program configuration and make the
configuration data easily accessible. Keys of a Yaco object can be
accessed both as regular dict keys (`a['key']`) or as attributes
(`a.key`). Lower level dictionaries are automatically converted to
Yaco objects allowing similar access (`a.key.subkey`). Lists are
(recursively) parsed and dictionaries in list are converted to Yaco
objects allowing access allong the lines of `a.key[3].subkey`."""
