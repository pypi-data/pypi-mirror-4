        Introduction: pCanary basic purpose
        ========================================
        
        pCanary is a opensource application that is used to lookup information on
        crafting and ores in the game Minecraft. It is written in Python and should 
        be compatible with most operating systems however it has been built for 
        Linux.
        
        pCanary will create a tk window that will become the interface of selecting
        different ores and recipes by the user. The tk window will give the user
        an idea on how to construct the crafting on a grid and it will also show
        the different ores and their purpose.
