Version 0.8.1 (2013-01-30)
--------------------------
 * Fix incorrect relative file access. This was a problem on Debian 7.0 and probably other platforms.

Version 0.8.0 (2012-04-02)
--------------------------
 * Support for disabling compressed archives to avoid slowdowns.

Version 0.7.2 (2011-08-07)
--------------------------
 * Implemented workaround for bug in rarfile where it returns a date with seconds > 59. Also notified Marko Kreen (author of rarfile) of the bug.

Version 0.7.1 (2011-06-20)
--------------------------
 * Not much of a PyarrFS change, but our required changes to rarfile is now no longer local but have been pushed and accepted into rarfile 2.3. This means we no longer require the hacked rarfile version but instead depend on the regular rarfile - awesome!

Version 0.7.0 (2011-02-02)
--------------------------
 * Reading of normal files! Previously, PyarrFS was only able to read rar files and would try to handle normal files just like it would a rar file, which would obviously not work. That's now fixed!
 * Relative root. The root from which PyarrFS should work and mount in the mount directory can now be specified.

Version 0.6.0 (2011-01-07)
--------------------------
Command line option parsing implemented somewhat. Logging configuration is
improved by the integration with command line options and the root dir can be
set, although it so far has no effect ;)

Version 0.5.0 (2011-01-07)
--------------------------
First version released, previous to this, pyarrfs was only available via git
The thing is basically working but has a few rough edges which will be worked
out before releasing 1.0
