Title: Lamson 1.0pre1 Released

Tonight I'm releasing Lamson 1.0pre1 with all the latest improvements I've made while
making "librelist.com":http://librelist.com/ and taking feedback from a few people
using Lamson.  The goal from now on will be to basically squash bugs and write docs, with
only a rare feature or two as I find them needed on projects.

h2. What's In This Release

This release features really only four major enhancements, and a bunch of little fixes 
here and there.

# There's now a working mailing list example in examples/librelist.
# The router now uses the envelope header To (message.To) instead of the headers.
# There is now very solid bounce detection and analysis.
# Modules can specify anything as the state key (from, to+from, module+to, etc.)

Here's the important changes from the change log by category:

h3. Enhancements

* 340 Added a version command finally, with some good information.
* 330 There is now a safe=False option to lamson.queue.Queue to use a modified Maildir that md5 hashes the original hostname used.
* 321 Routing it more deterministic and a bit quicker.  It now uses the envelope To for routing.
* 320 Refactored the routing to it is more deterministic and doesn't loop over the functions mulitple times.  Still some work to do though.
* 314 Bounce information now includes the original messages in easier to access forms.
* 308 Got bounce handling working and tested.
* 303 Slight reorg with the way @state_key_generator is implemented.
* 302 Implemented a means to specify that a module will key off of different parts of a message.
* 301 Got tired of not seeing errors during test runs so I made an option in the Router to explode on exceptions vs. log them.
* 300 Bounce routing decorator for doing the actual routing of messages that are bounces.
* 296 Implemented a bounce analysis method that is simple but seems to work on most bounce mail.

h3. Bug Fixes 

* 329 Found an email that had a nasty header causing an edge case in the parser.
* 325 Bounce detection was using the wrong email address.
* 319 Removed the egg dependency on sqlalchemy.
* 318 Moved the bounce stuff around in order to make it more advanced.
* 307 Fixed up the @bounce_to decorator so that it returns the next state.
* 294 Small bug in multipart handling where content types of 'message/' can be multipart too.

h3. Librelist Related

* 323 librelist.com sample is looking good, bounce handling is working, archives are started.
* 322 Super bounce handling for librelist.com.
* 306 Got the first cut of the whole app.handlers.admin working, including bounces, but Lamson bounce detection has a flaw.
* 305 Got the basics of making mailing lists, managing subscribers.
* 304 Initial commit of the librelist.com sample application.

Also, librelist demonstrates how to integrate Lamson with "Django":http://www.djangoproject.com/ which
turns out to just require a couple lines of code.  I'll have some documentation on that soon.


h3. Docs and Website Related

* 317 Removed references to SQLAlchemy being needed in the docs.


h2. Getting This Release

As usual, try to install it using "easy_install":http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
and make sure you do the upgrade:

<pre class="code prettyprint">
$ sudo easy_install -U lamson
</pre>

This release does not depend on SQLAlchemy anymore, since you can really use Lamson with any
data source you can access with Python.  As mentioned above, the librelist sample uses
Django models.

If you want to download the source you can visit the "releases":/releases/ page and 
grab it from there.


h2. Mailing List Back Online

Finally, the lamson mailing list is now back online, so you can subscribe to it 
and get help.  Read "the lists page":/lists/ to find out more.

h2. IRC Channel

I'm also more active in the IRC channel #lamson on irc.freenode.org.  Come by 
if you need help.

Thanks again folks, and shoot me any bugs you find.
