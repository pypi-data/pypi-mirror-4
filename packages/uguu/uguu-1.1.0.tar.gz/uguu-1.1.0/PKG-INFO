Description: 
                uguu is a tool to generate flexget configuration
                files, which aren't well suited to some use cases, one being having a
                separate feed for every
                series, which is important for fast moving RSS feeds such as
                Nyaatorrents, or simply if one likes
                to download a series without batches using flexget.
