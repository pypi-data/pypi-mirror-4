Description: This package contains generic base classes for channel-based servers, the
        servers themselves and helper objects, such as tasks and requests.
        
        ============
        WSGI Support
        ============
        
        `zope.server`'s HTTP server comes with WSGI_ support.
        ``zope.server.http.wsgihttpserver.WSGIHTTPServer`` can act as a WSGI gateway.
        There's also an entry point for PasteDeploy_ that lets you use zope.server's
        WSGI gateway from a configuration file, e.g.::
        
          [server:main]
          use = egg:zope.server
          host = 127.0.0.1
          port = 8080

        CHANGES
        =======
        
        3.9.0 (2013-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Better adherence to WSGI:
        
          * Call close method if present on iterables returned by 
            ``start_response``.
        
          * Don't include non-string values in the CGI environment
            (``CHANNEL_CREATION_TIME``).
        
          * Always include ``QUERY_STRING`` to avoid the cgi module falling back 
            to ``sys.argv``.
        
          * Add tests based on `paste.lint` middleware.
        
        - Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
          ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.
        
        - Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.
        
        - Exceptions that happen in the handler thread main loop are logged so that
          the unexpected death of a handler thread does not happen in silence.
        
        
        3.8.6 (2012-01-07)
        ------------------
        
        - On startup, HTTPServer prints a clickable URL after the hostname/port.
        
        
        3.8.5 (2011-09-13)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed bug: requests lasting over 15 minutes were sometimes closed
          prematurely.
        
        3.8.4 (2011-06-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix syntax error in tests on Python < 2.6.
        
        
        3.8.3 (2011-05-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Made ``start_response`` method of WSGI server implementation more compliant
          with spec:
        
            http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#the-start-response-callable
        
        3.8.2 (2010-12-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Corrected license version in ``zope/server/http/tests/test_wsgiserver.py``.
        
        3.8.1 (2010-08-24)
        ------------------
        
        - When the result of a WSGI application was received, ``task.write()`` was
          only called once to transmit the data. This prohibited the transmission of
          partial results. Now the WSGI server iterates through the result itself
          making multiple ``task.write()`` calls, which will cause partial data to be
          transmitted.
        
        - Created a second test case instance for the post-mortem WSGI server, so it
          is tested as well.
        
        - Using python's ``doctest`` module instead of deprecated
          ``zope.testing.doctest``.
        
        3.8.0 (2010-08-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented correct server proxy behavior. The HTTP server would always add
          a "Server" and "Date" response header to the list of response headers
          regardless whether one had been set already. The HTTP 1.1 spec specifies
          that a proxy server must not modify the "Server" and "Date" header but add a
          "Via" header instead.
        
        3.7.0 (2010-08-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Implemented proxy support. Proxy requests contain a full URIs and the
          request parser used to throw that information away. Using
          ``urlparse.urlsplit()``, all pieces of the URL are recorded.
        
        - The proxy scheme and netloc/hostname are exposed in the WSGI environment as
          ``zserver.proxy.scheme`` and ``zserver.proxy.host``.
        
        - Made tests runnable via buildout again.
        
        3.6.2 (2010-06-11)
        ------------------
        
        - The log message "Exception during task" is no longer logged to the root
          logger but to zope.server.taskthreads.
        
        
        3.6.1 (2009-10-07)
        ------------------
        
        - Made tests pass with current zope.publisher which restricts redirects to the
          current host by default.
        
        
        3.6.0 (2009-05-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved some imports from test modules to their setUp to prevent
          failures when ZEO tests are run by the same testrunner
        
        - Removed unused dependency on zope.deprecation.
        
        - Remove old zpkg-related DEPENDENCIES.cfg file.
        
        
        3.5.0 (2008-03-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Improve package meta-data.
        
        - Fix of 599 error on conflict error in request
          see: http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2008-January/030844.html
        
        - Removed dependency on ZODB.
        
        
        3.5.0a2 (2007-06-02)
        --------------------
        
        - Made WSGI server really WSGI-compliant by adding variables to the
          environment that are required by the spec.
        
        
        3.5.0a1 (2007-06-02)
        --------------------
        
        - Added a factory and entry point for PasteDeploy.
        
        
        3.4.3 (2008-08-18)
        ------------------
        
        - Moved some imports from test modules to their setUp to prevent
          failures when ZEO tests are run by the same testrunner
        
        
        3.4.2 (2008-02-02)
        ------------------

        - Made WSGI server really WSGI-compliant by adding variables to the
          environment that are required by the spec.
        
        
        3.4.0 (2007-06-02)
        ------------------
        
        - Removed an unused import. Unchanged otherwise.
        
        
        3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
        --------------------
        
        - Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to zope.server
          from Zope 3.4.0a1
        
        - Made WSGI server really WSGI-compliant by adding variables to the
          environment that are required by the spec.
