15-minute delayed info
----------------------

When you make a request, 15-minute-old information is retrieved. You can check the date and time with ``stock.time``. Example::

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    from pybovespa.pybovespa import Bovespa

    bovespa = Bovespa()
    stock = bovespa.query("PETR3")
    print(stock.cod, stock.name, stock.last)

The output should be something like this::

    PETR3 PETROBRAS ON 24,24

It is possible to make only one request for many stocks::

    stocks = bovespa.query("PETR4", "VALE5", "OGXP3")
    for stock in stocks.values():
        print(stock.cod, stock.last)

    stock_vale = stocks["VALE5"]

Historical stock data
---------------------

Unfortunately, BM&FBovespa does not allow the distribution of their data. However, it is very simple to download them using this library::

    bovespa = Bovespa()
    bovespa.download(dst="/tmp/hist", year="2012", overwrite=True)

To download data of all available years::

    bovespa.download_all(dst="/tmp/hist", overwrite=True)
