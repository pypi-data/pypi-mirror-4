Introduction
============

This is a Plone add-on and part of the adi.simplesite-package-bundle.

adi.slickstyle is a theme add-on for Plone, which overrides the default styles (namely public.css) with some decent styles and let's you easily override font-color, link-styles and bg-color globally. 

See the stylesheet (adi/slickstyle/adi_slick.css) for the collected selectors.
