 Sigal
=======

Sigal is yet another simple static gallery generator. It's written in Python
and it allows to build a static gallery of images with the following features:

* process directories recursively,
* generate HTML pages using jinja2 templates,
* relative links for a portable output,
* parallel processing,
* MIT licensed.

The idea behind Sigal is to ease the use of the javascript librairies like
`galleria`_. These librairies do a great job to display the images, Sigal does
what is missing: resize images, create thumbnails, generate html pages.

Sigal is currently compatible only with python 2. It will be ported to python
3 when PIL/Pillow will be available for python 3.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Argh
- Jinja2
- Python Imaging Library (PIL / Pillow)
- Python Markdown


How to Use
----------

To get started, just run ``sigal init`` which will copy an example
configuration file in the current directory. All configuration values have a
default; values that are commented out serve to show the default. Default
values are specified when modified in this example config file.

After adapting the configuration to your needs, put your images in a
sub-directory and run ``sigal build <your images directory>``. The next time
you run ``sigal build``, only the new images will be processed. Use the ``-f``
flag to force the reprocessing of all the images.

To visualize your gallery, you can use ``sigal serve`` which runs a basic web
server. This server should only be used for local browsing, not in production.
Another option is to use the ``index_in_url = True`` setting, which will add
``index.html`` to the urls to allow browsing without a server.


Help of the ``sigal build`` command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ sigal build [-h] [-d] [-v] [-f] [-c CONFIG] [-t THEME]
            input_dir [output_dir]

Required arguments:

``input_dir``
  Input directory

Optional arguments:

``output_dir``
  Output directory (default: ``_build/``)

``-h, --help``
  Show this help message and exit

``-f, --force``
  Force the reprocessing of existing images and thumbnails

``-v, --verbose``
  Show all messages

``-d, --debug``
  Show all message, including debug messages

``-c CONFIG, --config CONFIG``
  Configuration file (default: ``<input_dir>/sigal.conf.py``)

``-t THEME, --theme THEME``
  Specify a theme directory, or a theme name for the themes included with Sigal

``-n NCPU, --ncpu NCPU``
  Number of cpu for parallel execution (default: 1)


Configuration
-------------

The configuration must be set in a ``sigal.conf.py`` file in the current
directory. It can also be specified with the ``-c`` flag. An example file with
explanations on the settings is available in ``sigal/templates/sigal.conf.py``
and is shown below. This file is copied to the current directory with the
``sigal init`` commmand.

.. literalinclude:: ../sigal/templates/sigal.conf.py
   :language: python


Album information
-----------------

Information on an album can be given in a file using the `markdown`_ syntax,
named ``index.md`` :

::

    Title: Another example gallery
    Thumbnail: test2.jpg

    And a *cool* description.

If this file does not exist the directory's name is used for the title, and
the first image of the directory is used as thumbnail.
