        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Knockback.js`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Knockback.js`: http://kmalakoff.github.com/knockback/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.knockback``) are published to some URL.
        
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``knockback`` from ``js.knockback`` and
        ``need`` it where you want these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.knockback import knockback
          >>> knockback.need()
