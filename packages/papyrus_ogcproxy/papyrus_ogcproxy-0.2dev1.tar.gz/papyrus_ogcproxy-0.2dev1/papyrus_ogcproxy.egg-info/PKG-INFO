Description: papyrus_ogcproxy
        =================
        
        papyrus_ogcproxy provides an easy and convenient method for embeding
        an OGC proxy in Pyramid applications.
        
        The source code of papyrus_ogcproxy is straightforward, so if
        papyrus_ogcproxy doesn't do what you want, open its source code, get
        inspiration, and write your own code.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        papyrus_ogcproxy can be installed with ``easy_install``::
        
            $ easy_install papyrus_ogcproxy
        
        Often you'll want to make papyrus_ogcproxy a dependency of your Pyramid
        application, which is done by adding ``papyrus_ogcproxy`` to the
        ``install_requires`` list defined in the Pyramid application's ``setup.py``
        file.
        
        Set up
        ------
        
        Using papyrus_ogcproxy to set an OGC proxy in a Pyramid application is easy.
        
        Edit the application's main file, ``__init__.py``, and register
        papyrus_ogcproxy using the ``Configurator.include`` method::
        
            def main(global_config, **settings):
        
                config = Configurator(settings=settings)
        
                import papyrus_ogcproxy
                config.include(papyrus_ogcproxy)
        
        That's it! The OGC proxy is available at ``/ogcproxy``.
        
        Here is a test URL:
        http://localhost:6543/ogcproxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwms.jpl.nasa.gov%2Fwms.cgi%3FSERVICE%3DWMS%26REQUEST%3DGetCapabilities
        
        Run the tests
        -------------
        
        To run the tests install the ``nose``, ``mock`` and ``coverage`` packages in
        the Python environment, and execute::
        
            $ nosetests --with-coverage
