0.0.6
=====

 * Don't use 'immediate' flag for publishing when not using
   pubacks - due to RabbitMQ 3.0 changes.
 * Support for some unusual data types in tables:
   None, float (including nan and inf) and some unsigned integers.
 * #19 - some more tweaks for that.
 * Support 'client_properties' parameter in constructor,
   which can be used to pass data to the browser.
 * RabbitMQ way of handling user/pass problems changed -
   the connection is now dropped instead of sending
   a connection-close method.
 * #17 - some more puback / fake puback tests
 * #15 - on windows errno.ENOTCONN had different value
   than on linux / mac.

   processes to get a copy of our descriptor.
 * #26 - basic support for AMQP heartbeats
